# Boost MSM backmp11 backend

This README file is temporary and contains information about `backmp11`, a new backend that is mostly backwards-compatible with `back`. It is currently in **experimental** stage, thus some details about the compatibility might change (feedback welcome!). This file's contents should eventually move into the MSM documentation.

The new backend has the following goals:

- reduce compilation runtime and RAM usage
- reduce state machine runtime

It is named after the metaprogramming library Boost Mp11, the main contributor to the optimizations. Usages of MPL are replaced with Mp11 to get rid of the costly C++03 emulation of variadic templates.

## Behavioral changes

### Visitor API

- The argument size limitation `BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE` has been removed, the new visitor implementation uses perfect forwarding.
- There is no need to declare an `accept_sig` in the base state, it is automatically derived from the signature of its `accept` method.
- As long as the state machine is not running (before start resp. after stop), no states will be visited. The previous behavior was errorneous in the following way:
    - If the SM was not started yet, the initial state(s) were visited
    - If the SM was stopped, the last active state(s) were visited


## How to use it

The backend and both its policies `favor_runtime_speed` and `favor_compile_time` should be compatible with existing code. Required replacements to try it out:
- use `boost::msm::backmp11::state_machine` in place of `boost::msm::back::state_machine` and
- use `boost::msm::backmp11::favor_compile_time` in place of `boost::msm::back::favor_compile_time`

When using the `favor_compile_time` policy, a different macro to generate missing parts of a SM is needed:
- use `BOOST_MSM_BACKMP11_GENERATE_DISPATCH_TABLE(<fsmname>)` in place of `BOOST_MSM_BACK_GENERATE_PROCESS_EVENT(<fsmname>)`


## Applied optimizations

- Replacement of CPU-intensive calls (due to C++03 recursion from MPL) with Mp11
- Applied type punning where useful (to reduce template instantiations, e.g. std::deque & other things around the dispatch table)


### `favor_runtime_speed` policy

Summary:
- Optimized cell initialization with initializer arrays (to reduce template instantiations)
- Default-initialized everything and afterwards only the defer transition cells


### `favor_compile_time` policy

Once an event is given to the FSM for processing, it is immediately converted to `any` and processing continues with this `any` event.
The structure of the dispatch table has been reworked, one dispatch table is created per state as a hash map.
The state dispatch tables are designed to directly work with the `any` event, they use the event's type index via its `type()` function as hash value.

This mechanism enables SMs to forward events to sub-SMs without requiring additional template instantiations just for forwarding as was needed with the `process_any_event` mechanism.
The new mechanism renders the `process_any_event` function obsolete and enables **forwarding of events to sub-SMs in O(1) complexity instead of O(N)**.

Summary:
- Use one dispatch table per state to reduce compiler processing time
  - The algorithms for processing the STT and states are optimized to go through rows and states only once
  - These dispatch tables are hash tables with type_id as key
- Apply type erasure with `any` as early as possible and do further processing only with any events
  - each dispatch table only has to cover the events it's handling, no template instantiations required for forwarding events to sub-SMs


### Learnings:

- If only a subset needs to be processed, prefer copy_if & transform over fold
- Selecting a template-based function overload in Mp11 seems more efficient than using enable_if/disable_if

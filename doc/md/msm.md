# Preface

*[â†‘ Back to top](#table-of-contents)*


MSM is a library allowing you to easily and quickly define state
machines of very high performance. From this point, two main questions
usually quickly arise, so please allow me to try answering them upfront.

-   When do I need a state machine?

    More often than you think. Very often, one defined a state machine
    informally without even noticing it. For example, one declares
    inside a class some boolean attribute, say to remember that a task
    has been completed. Later the boolean actually needs a third value,
    so it becomes an int. A few weeks, a second attribute is needed.
    Then a third. Soon, you find yourself writing:

    `void incoming_data(data)`

    `{`

    `if (data == packet_3 && flag1 == work_done && flag2 > step3)...`

    `}`

    This starts to look like event processing (contained inside data) if
    some stage of the object life has been achieved (but is ugly).

    This could be a protocol definition and it is a common use case for
    state machines. Another common one is a user interface. The stage of
    the user\'s interaction defines if some button is active, a
    functionality is available, etc.

    But there are many more use cases if you start looking. Actually, a
    whole model-driven development method, Executable UML
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML) specifies its complete
    dynamic behavior using state machines. Class diagram, state machine
    diagrams, and an action language are all you absolutely need in the
    Executable UML world.

-   Another state machine library? What for?

    True, there are many state machine libraries. This should already be
    an indication that if you\'re not using any of them, you might be
    missing something. Why should you use this one? Unfortunately, when
    looking for a good state machine library, you usually pretty fast
    hit one or several of the following snags:

    -   speed: \"state machines are slow\" is usually the first
        criticism you might hear. While it is often an excuse not to use
        any and instead resort to dirty, hand-written implementations (I
        mean, no, yours are not dirty of course, I\'m talking about
        other developers). MSM removes this often feeble excuse because
        it is blazingly fast. Most hand-written implementations will be
        beaten by MSM.

    -   ease of use: good argument. If you used another library, you are
        probably right. Many state machine definitions will look similar
        to:

        `state s1 = new State; // a state`

        `state s2 = new State; // another state`

        `event e = new Event; // event`

        `s1->addTransition(e,s2); // transition s1 -> s2`

        The more transitions you have, the less readable it is. A long
        time ago, there was not so much Java yet, and many electronic
        systems were built with a state machine defined by a simple
        transition table. You could easily see the whole structure and
        immediately see if you forgot some transitions. Thanks to our
        new OO techniques, this ease of use was gone. MSM gives you back
        the transition table and reduces the noise to the minimum.

    -   expressiveness: MSM offers several front-ends and constantly
        tries to improve state machine definition techniques. For
        example, you can define a transition with eUML (one of MSM\'s
        front-ends) as:

        `state1 == state2 + event [condition] / action`

        This is not simply syntactic sugar. Such a formalized, readable
        structure allows easy communication with domain experts of a
        software to be constructed. Having domain experts understand
        your code will greatly reduce the number of bugs.

    -   model-driven-development: a common difficulty of a model-driven
        development is the complexity of making a round-trip (generating
        code from model and then model from code). This is due to the
        fact that if a state machine structure is hard for you to read,
        chances are that your parsing tool will also have a hard time.
        MSM\'s syntax will hopefully help tool writers.

    -   features: most developers use only 20% of the richly defined UML
        standard. Unfortunately, these are never the same 20% for all.
        And so, very likely, one will need something from the standard
        which is not implemented. MSM offers a very large part of the
        standard, with more on the way.

    Let us not wait any longer, I hope you will enjoy MSM and have fun
    with it!

# Founding idea

*[â†‘ Back to top](#table-of-contents)*


Let\'s start with an example taken from the C++ Template Metaprogramming
book:

    class player : public state_machine<player>
    { 
      // The list of FSM states enum states { Empty, Open, Stopped, Playing, Paused , initial_state = Empty }; 

      // transition actions 
      void start_playback(play const&) { std::cout << "player::start_playback\n"; } 
      void open_drawer(open_close const&) { std::cout << "player::open_drawer\n"; } 
      // more transition actions
      ...
      typedef player p; // makes transition table cleaner 
      struct transition_table : mpl::vector11< 
      //    Start     Event        Target      Action                       
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
        row< Stopped , play       ,  Playing  , &p::start_playback        >,
        row< Stopped , open_close ,  Open     , &::open_drawer            >,
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
        row< Open    , open_close ,  Empty    , &p::close_drawer          >,
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
        row< Empty   , open_close ,  Open     , &p::open_drawer           >,
        row< Empty   , cd_detected,  Stopped  , &p::store_cd_info         >,
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
        row< Playing , stop       ,  Stopped  , &p::stop_playback         >,
        row< Playing , pause      ,  Paused   , &p::pause_playback        >,
        row< Playing , open_close ,  Open     , &p::stop_and_open         >,
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
        row< Paused  , play       ,  Playing  , &p::resume_playback       >,
        row< Paused  , stop       ,  Stopped  , &p::stop_playback         >,
        row< Paused  , open_close ,  Open     , &p::stop_and_open         >
      //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+ 
      > {};
      // Replaces the default no-transition response. 
      template <class Event> 
      int no_transition(int state, Event const& e)
      { 
        std::cout << "no transition from state " << state << " on event " << typeid(e).name() << std::endl; 
        return state; 
      }
    };                        

This example is the foundation for the idea driving MSM: a descriptive
and expressive language based on a transition table with as little
syntactic noise as possible, all this while offering as many features
from the UML 2.0 standard as possible. MSM also offers several
expressive state machine definition syntaxes with different trade-offs.

# UML Short Guide

*[â†‘ Back to top](#table-of-contents)*


## What are state machines?

State machines are the description of a thing\'s lifeline. They describe
the different stages of the lifeline, the events influencing it, and
what it does when a particular event is detected at a particular stage.
They offer the complete specification of the dynamic behavior of the
thing.

## Concepts

Thinking in terms of state machines is a bit surprising at first, so let
us have a quick glance at the concepts.

### State machine, state, transition, event

A state machine is a concrete model describing the behavior of a system.
It is composed of a finite number of states and transitions.

![](../images/sm.gif)

A simple state has no sub states. It can have data, entry and exit
behaviors and deferred events. One can provide entry and exit behaviors
(also called actions) to states (or state machines), which are executed
whenever a state is entered or left, no matter how. A state can also
have internal transitions which cause no entry or exit behavior to be
called. A state can mark events as deferred. This means the event cannot
be processed if this state is active, but it must be retained. Next time
a state not deferring this event is active, the event will be processed,
as if it had just been fired.

![](../images/state.gif)

A transition is the switching between active states, triggered by an
event. Actions and guard conditions can be attached to the transition.
The action executes when the transition fires, the guard is a Boolean
operation executed first and which can prevent the transition from
firing by returning false.

![](../images/transition.jpg)

An initial state marks the first active state of a state machine. It has
no real existence and neither has the transition originating from it.

![](../images/init_state.gif)

### Submachines, orthogonal regions, pseudostates

A composite state is a state containing a region or decomposed in two or
more regions. A composite state contains its own set of states and
regions.

A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in another state
machine. The same submachine can be inserted more than once.

Orthogonal regions are parts of a composite state or submachine, each
having its own set of mutually exclusive set of states and transitions.

![](../images/regions.gif)
UML also defines a number of pseudo states, which are considered
important concepts to model, but not enough to make them first-class
citizens. The terminate pseudo state terminates the execution of a state
machine (MSM handles this slightly differently; the state machine is not
destroyed but no further event processing occurs).

![](../images/terminate.gif)

An exit point pseudo state exits a composite state or a submachine and
forces termination of execution in all contained regions.

![](../images/exit.gif)
An entry point pseudo state allows a kind of controlled entry inside a
composite. Precisely, it connects a transition outside the composite to
a transition inside the composite. An important point is that this
mechanism only allows a single region to be entered. In the above
diagram, in region1, the initial state would become active.

![](../images/entry_point.gif)

There are also two more ways to enter a submachine (apart the obvious
and more common case of a transition terminating on the submachine as
shown in the region case). An explicit entry means that an inside state
is the target of a transition. Unlike with direct entry, no tentative
encapsulation is made, and only one transition is executed. An explicit
exit is a transition from an inner state to a state outside the
submachine (not supported by MSM). I would not recommend using explicit
entry or exit.

![](../images/explicit.gif)

The last entry possibility is using fork. A fork is an explicit entry
into one or more regions. Other regions are again activated using their
initial state.

![](../images/fork.gif)

<a id="uml-history"></a>
### History

UML defines two kinds of history, shallow history and deep history.
Shallow history is a pseudo state representing the most recent substate
of a submachine. A submachine can have at most one shallow history. A
transition with a history pseudo state as target is equivalent to a
transition with the most recent substate as target. And very
importantly, only one transition may originate from the history. Deep
history is a shallow history recursively reactivating the substates of
the most recent substate. It is represented like the shallow history
with a star (H\* inside a circle).

![](../images/history.gif)
History is not a completely satisfying concept. First of all, there can
be just one history pseudo state and only one transition may originate
from it. So they do not mix well with orthogonal regions as only one
region can be "remembered". Deep history is even worse and looks like a
last-minute addition. History has to be activated by a transition and
only one transition originates from it, so how to model the transition
originating from the deep history pseudo state and pointing to the most
recent substate of the substate? As a bonus, it is also inflexible and
does not accept new types of histories. Let\'s face it, history sounds
great and is useful in theory, but the UML version is not quite making
the cut. And therefore, MSM provides a different version of this useful
concept.

<a id="uml-anonymous"></a>
### Completion transitions / anonymous transitions

Completion events (or transitions), also called anonymous transitions,
are defined as transitions having no defined event triggering them. This
means that such transitions will immediately fire when a state being the
source of an anonymous transition becomes active, provided that a guard
allows it. They are useful in modeling algorithms as an activity diagram
would normally do. In the real-time world, they have the advantage of
making it easier to estimate how long a periodically executed action
will last. For example, consider the following diagram.

![](../images/completion.gif)

The designer now knows at any time that he will need a maximum of 4
transitions. Being able to estimate how long a transition takes, he can
estimate how much of a time frame he will need to require (real-time
tasks are often executed at regular intervals). If he can also estimate
the duration of actions, he can even use graph algorithms to better
estimate his timing requirements.

<a id="UML-internal-transition"></a>
### Internal transitions

Internal transitions are transitions executing in the scope of the
active state, being a simple state or a submachine. One can see them as
a self-transition of this state, without an entry or exit action called.

<a id="transition-conflict"></a>
### Conflicting transitions

If, for a given event, several transitions are enabled, they are said to
be in conflict. There are two kinds of conflicts:

-   For a given source state, several transitions are defined, triggered
    by the same event. Normally, the guard condition in each transition
    defines which one is fired.

-   The source state is a submachine or simple state and the conflict is
    between a transition internal to this state and a transition
    triggered by the same event and having as target another state.

The first one is simple; one only needs to define two or more rows in
the transition table, with the same source and trigger, with a different
guard condition. Beware, however, that the UML standard wants these
conditions to be not overlapping. If they do, the standard says nothing
except that this is incorrect, so the implementer is free to implement
it the way he sees fit. In the case of MSM, the transition appearing
last in the transition table gets selected first, if it returns false
(meaning disabled), the library tries with the previous one, and so on.

![](../images/conflict1.gif)

In the second case, UML defines that the most inner transition gets
selected first, which makes sense, otherwise no exit point pseudo state
would be possible (the inner transition brings us to the exit point,
from where the containing state machine can take over).

![](../images/conflict2.gif)
MSM handles both cases itself, so the designer needs only concentrate on
its state machine and the UML subtleties (not overlapping conditions),
not on implementing this behavior himself.

## Added concepts

-   Interrupt states: a terminate state which can be exited if a defined
    event is triggered.

-   Kleene (any) event: a transition with a kleene event will accept any
    event as trigger. Unlike a completion transition, an event must be
    triggered and the original event is kept accessible in the kleene
    event.

## State machine glossary

-   state machine: the life cycle of a thing. It is made of states,
    regions, transitions and processes incoming events.

-   state: a stage in the life cycle of a state machine. A state (like a
    submachine) can have an entry and exit behaviors.

-   event: an incident provoking (or not) a reaction of the state
    machine

-   transition: a specification of how a state machine reacts to an
    event. It specifies a source state, the event triggering the
    transition, the target state (which will become the newly active
    state if the transition is triggered), guard and actions.

-   action: an operation executed during the triggering of the
    transition.

-   guard: a boolean operation being able to prevent the triggering of a
    transition which would otherwise fire.

-   transition table: representation of a state machine. A state machine
    diagram is a graphical, but incomplete representation of the same
    model. A transition table, on the other hand, is a complete
    representation.

-   initial state: The state in which the state machine starts. Having
    several orthogonal regions means having as many initial states.

-   submachine: A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in
    another state machine and can be found several times in a same state
    machine.

-   orthogonal regions: (logical) parallel flow of execution of a state
    machine. Every region of a state machine gets a chance to process an
    incoming event.

-   terminate pseudo-state: when this state becomes active, it
    terminates the execution of the whole state machine. MSM does not
    destroy the state machine as required by the UML standard, however,
    which lets you keep all the state machine\'s data.

-   entry/exit pseudo state: defined for submachines and are defined as
    a connection between a transition outside of the submachine and a
    transition inside the submachine. It is a way to enter or leave a
    submachine through a predefined point.

-   fork: a fork allows explicit entry into several orthogonal regions
    of a submachine.

-   history: a history is a way to remember the active state of a
    submachine so that the submachine can proceed in its last active
    state next time it becomes active.

-   completion events (also called completion/anonymous transitions):
    when a transition has no named event triggering it, it automatically
    fires when the source state is active, unless a guard forbids it.

-   transition conflict: a conflict is present if for a given source
    state and incoming event, several transitions are possible. UML
    specifies that guard conditions have to solve the conflict.

-   internal transitions: transition from a state to itself without
    having exit and entry actions being called.

MSM is divided between front-ends and back-ends. At the moment, there is
just one back-end. On the front-end side, you will find three of them
which are as many state machine description languages, with many more
possible. For potential language writers, this document contains a
[description of the interface between front-end and
back-end](#internals-front-back-interface).

The first front-end is an adaptation of the example provided in the [MPL
book](http://boostpro.com/mplbook) with actions defined as pointers to
state or state machine methods. The second one is based on functors. The
third, eUML (embedded UML) is an experimental language based on
Boost.Proto and Boost.Typeof and hiding most of the metaprogramming to
increase readability. Both eUML and the functor front-end also offer a
functional library (a bit like Boost.Phoenix) for use as action language
(UML defining none).

## Basic front-end

This is the historical front-end, inherited from the MPL book. It
provides a transition table made of rows of different names and
functionality. Actions and guards are defined as methods and referenced
through a pointer in the transition. This front-end provides a simple
interface making easy state machines easy to define, but more complex
state machines a bit harder.

### A simple example

Let us have a look at a state machine diagram of the founding example:

![](../images/SimpleTutorial.jpg)
We are now going to build it with MSM\'s basic front-end. An
[implementation](../examples/SimpleTutorial.cpp) is also provided.

### Transition table

As previously stated, MSM is based on the transition table, so let us
define one:

     
    struct transition_table : mpl::vector<
    //    Start     Event        Target      Action                      Guard 
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    a_row< Stopped , play       ,  Playing  , &player_::start_playback                               >,
    a_row< Stopped , open_close ,  Open     , &player_::open_drawer                                  >,
     _row< Stopped , stop       ,  Stopped                                                           >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    a_row< Open    , open_close ,  Empty    , &player_::close_drawer                                 >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    a_row< Empty   , open_close ,  Open     , &player_::open_drawer                                  >,
      row< Empty   , cd_detected,  Stopped  , &player_::store_cd_info   , &player_::good_disk_format >,
      row< Empty   , cd_detected,  Playing  , &player_::store_cd_info   , &player_::auto_start       >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    a_row< Playing , stop       ,  Stopped  , &player_::stop_playback                                >,
    a_row< Playing , pause      ,  Paused   , &player_::pause_playback                               >,
    a_row< Playing , open_close ,  Open     , &player_::stop_and_open                                >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    a_row< Paused  , end_pause  ,  Playing  , &player_::resume_playback                              >,
    a_row< Paused  , stop       ,  Stopped  , &player_::stop_playback                                >,
    a_row< Paused  , open_close ,  Open     , &player_::stop_and_open                                >
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    > {};
                            

You will notice that this is almost exactly our founding example. The
only change in the transition table is the different types of
transitions (rows). The founding example forces one to define an action
method and offers no guards. You have 4 basic row types:

-   `row` takes 5 arguments: start state, event, target state, action
    and guard.

-   `a_row` ("a" for action) allows defining only the action and omit
    the guard condition.

-   `g_row` ("g" for guard) allows omitting the action behavior and
    defining only the guard.

-   `_row` allows omitting action and guard.

The signature for an action method is void method_name (event const&),
for example:

    void stop_playback(stop const&)

Action methods return nothing and take the argument as const reference.
Of course nothing forbids you from using the same action for several
events:

    template <class Event> void stop_playback(Event const&)

Guards have as only difference the return value, which is a boolean:

    bool good_disk_format(cd_detected const& evt)

### Defining states with entry/exit actions

While states were enums in the MPL book, they now are classes, which
allows them to hold data, provide entry, exit behaviors and be reusable
(as they do not know anything about the containing state machine). To
define a state, inherit from the desired state type. You will mainly use
simple states:

struct Empty : public msm::front::state\<\> {};

They can optionally provide entry and exit behaviors:

``` C++
struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> 
{
    template <class Event, class Fsm> 
    void on_entry(Event const&, Fsm& ) 
    {std::cout <<"entering: Empty" << std::endl;} 
    template <class Event, class Fsm> 
    void on_exit(Event const&, Fsm& ) 
    {std::cout <<"leaving: Empty" << std::endl;} 
};
                    
```

Notice how the entry and exit behaviors are templatized on the event and
state machine. Being generic facilitates reuse. There are more state
types (terminate, interrupt, pseudo states, etc.) corresponding to the
UML standard state types. These will be described in details in the next
sections.

### What do you actually do inside actions / guards?

State machines define a structure and important parts of the complete
behavior, but not all. For example if you need to send a rocket to Alpha
Centauri, you can have a transition to a state
\"SendRocketToAlphaCentauri\" but no code actually sending the rocket.
This is where you need actions. So a simple action could be:

    template <class Fire> void send_rocket(Fire const&)
    {
      fire_rocket();
    }

Ok, this was simple. Now, we might want to give a direction. Let us
suppose this information is externally given when needed, it makes sense
to use the event for this:

    // Event
    struct Fire {Direction direction;};
    template <class Fire> void send_rocket(Fire const& evt)
    {
      fire_rocket(evt.direction);
    }

We might want to calculate the direction based not only on external data
but also on data accumulated during previous work. In this case, you
might want to have this data in the state machine itself. As transition
actions are members of the front-end, you can directly access the data:

    // Event
    struct Fire {Direction direction;};
    //front-end definition, see down
    struct launcher_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<launcher_>{
    Data current_calculation; 
    template <class Fire> void send_rocket(Fire const& evt)
    {
      fire_rocket(evt.direction, current_calculation);
    }
    ...
    };

Entry and exit actions represent a behavior common to a state, no matter
through which transition it is entered or left. States being reusable,
it might make sense to locate your data there instead of in the state
machine, to maximize reuse and make code more readable. Entry and exit
actions have access to the state data (being state members) but also to
the event and state machine, like transition actions. This happens
through the Event and Fsm template parameters:

    struct Launching : public msm::front::state<> 
    {
        template <class Event, class Fsm> 
        void on_entry(Event const& evt, Fsm& fsm) 
        {
           fire_rocket(evt.direction, fsm.current_calculation);
        } 
    };

Exit actions are also ideal for cleanup when the state becomes inactive.

Another possible use of the entry action is to pass data to substates /
submachines. Launching is a substate containing a `data` attribute:

    struct launcher_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<launcher_>{
    Data current_calculation;
    // state machines also have entry/exit actions 
    template <class Event, class Fsm> 
    void on_entry(Event const& evt, Fsm& fsm) 
    {
       launcher_::Launching& s = fsm.get_state<launcher_::Launching&>();
       s.data = fsm.current_calculation;
    } 
    ...
    };

The `set_states` back-end method allows you to replace a complete state.

The `functor` front-end and eUML offer more capabilities.

However, this basic front-end also has special capabilities using the
row2 / irow2
transitions.`_row2, a_row2, row2, g_row2, a_irow2, irow2, g_irow2` let
you call an action located in any state of the current fsm or in the
front-end itself, thus letting you place useful data anywhere you see
fit.

It is sometimes desirable to generate new events for the state machine
inside actions. Since the process_event method belongs to the back end,
you first need to gain a reference to it. The back end derives from the
front end, so one way of doing this is to use a cast:

    struct launcher_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<launcher_>{
    template <class Fire> void send_rocket(Fire const& evt)
    {
      fire_rocket();
      msm::back::state_machine<launcher_> &fsm = static_cast<msm::back::state_machine<launcher_> &>(*this);
      fsm.process_event(rocket_launched());
    }
    ...
    };

The same can be implemented inside entry/exit actions. Admittedly, this
is a bit awkward. A more natural mechanism is available using the
`functor` front-end.

### Defining a simple state machine

Declaring a state machine is straightforward and is done with a high
signal / noise ratio. In our player example, we declare the state
machine as:

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>{
                                /* see below */}

This declares a state machine using the basic front-end. We now declare
inside the state machine structure the initial state:

    typedef Empty initial_state;

And that is about all of what is absolutely needed. In the example, the
states are declared inside the state machine for readability but this is
not a requirement, states can be declared wherever you like.

All what is left to do is to pick a back-end (which is quite simple as
there is only one at the moment):

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<player_> player;

You now have a ready-to-use state machine with entry/exit actions,
guards, transition actions, a message queue so that processing an event
can generate another event. The state machine also adapted itself to
your need and removed almost all features we didn\'t use in this simple
example. Note that this is not per default the fastest possible state
machine. See the section \"getting more speed\" to know how to get the
maximum speed. In a nutshell, MSM cannot know about your usage of some
features so you will have to explicitly tell it.

State objects are built automatically with the state machine. They will
exist until state machine destruction.

When an unexpected event is fired, the
`no_transition(event, state machine, state id)` method of the state
machine is called. By default, this method simply asserts when called.
It is possible to overwrite the `no_transition` method to define a
different handling:

    template <class Fsm,class Event> 
    void no_transition(Event const& e, Fsm& ,int state){...}

*Note*: you might have noticed that the tutorial calls `start()` on the
state machine just after creation. The start method will initiate the
state machine, meaning it will activate the initial state, which means
in turn that the initial state\'s entry behavior will be called. The
reason why we need this will be explained in the [back-end
part](#backend-start). After a call to start, the state machine is ready
to process events. The same way, calling `stop()` will cause the last
exit actions to be called.

### Defining a submachine

We now want to extend our last state machine by making the Playing state
a state machine itself (a submachine).

![](../images/CompositeTutorial.jpg)
Again, an [example](../examples/CompositeTutorial.cpp) is also provided.

A submachine really is a state machine itself, so we declare Playing as
such, choosing a front-end and a back-end:

    struct Playing_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<Playing_>{...} 
    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<Playing_> Playing;

Like for any state machine, one also needs a transition table and an
initial state:

     
    struct transition_table : mpl::vector<
    //    Start    Event    Target    Action                      Guard 
    //   +--------+-------------+--------+---------------------------+------+ 
    a_row< Song1  , NextSong    , Song2  , &Playing_::start_next_song        >,
    a_row< Song2  , PreviousSong, Song1  , &Playing_::start_prev_song        >,
    a_row< Song2  , NextSong    , Song3  , &Playing_::start_next_song        >,
    a_row< Song3  , PreviousSong, Song2  , &Playing_::start_prev_song        >
    //   +--------+-------------+--------+---------------------------+------+ 
    > {};
                            

    typedef Song1 initial_state; 

This is about all you need to do. MSM will now automatically recognize
Playing as a submachine and all events handled by Playing (NextSong and
PreviousSong) will now be automatically forwarded to Playing whenever
this state is active. All other state machine features described later
are also available. You can even decide to use a state machine sometimes
as submachine or sometimes as an independent state machine.

<a id="limitation-submachine"></a>
There is, however, a limitation for
submachines. If a submachine\'s substate has an entry action which
requires a special event property (like a given method), the compiler
will require all events entering this submachine to support this
property. As this is not practicable, we will need to use
`boost::enable_if` / `boost::disable_if` to help, for example consider:

    // define a property for use with enable_if 
    BOOST_MPL_HAS_XXX_TRAIT_DEF(some_event_property)

    // this event supports some_event_property and a corresponding required method
    struct event1
    {
       // the property
       typedef int some_event_property;
       // the method required by this property
       void some_property(){...}
    };
    // this event does not support some_event_property
    struct event2
    {
    };
    struct some_state : public msm::front::state<>
    {
       template <class Event,class Fsm>
       // enable this version for events supporting some_event_property
       typename boost::enable_if<typename has_some_event_property<Event>::type,void>::type
       on_entry(Event const& evt,Fsm& fsm)
       {
          evt.some_property();
       }
       // for events not supporting some_event_property
       template <class Event,class Fsm>
       typename boost::disable_if<typename has_some_event_property<Event>::type,void>::type
       on_entry(Event const& ,Fsm& )
       {    }
    };                        

Now this state can be used in your submachine.

### Orthogonal regions, terminate state, event deferring

It is a very common problem in many state machines to have to handle
errors. It usually involves defining a transition from all the states to
a special error state. Translation: not fun. It is also not practical to
find from which state the error originated. The following diagram shows
an example of what clearly becomes not very readable:

![](../images/error_no_regions.jpg)
This is neither very readable nor beautiful. And we do not even have any
action on the transitions yet to make it even less readable.

Luckily, UML provides a helpful concept, orthogonal regions. See them as
lightweight state machines running at the same time inside a common
state machine and having the capability to influence one another. The
effect is that you have several active states at any time. We can
therefore keep our state machine from the previous example and just
define a new region made of two states, AllOk and ErrorMode. AllOk is
most of the time active. But the error_found error event makes the
second region move to the new active state ErrorMode. This event does
not interest the main region so it will simply be ignored.
\"`no_transition`\" will be called only if no region at all handles the
event. Also, as UML mandates, every region gets a chance of handling the
event, in the order as declared by the `initial_state` type.

Adding an orthogonal region is easy, one only needs to declare more
states in the `initial_state` typedef. So, adding a new region with
AllOk as the region\'s initial state is:

    typedef mpl::vector<Empty,AllOk> initial_state;

![](../images/Orthogonal-deferred.jpg)
Furthermore, when you detect an error, you usually do not want events to
be further processed. To achieve this, we use another UML feature,
terminate states. When any region moves to a terminate state, the state
machine "terminates" (the state machine and all its states stay alive)
and all events are ignored. This is of course not mandatory, one can use
orthogonal regions without terminate states. MSM also provides a small
extension to UML, interrupt states. If you declare ErrorMode (or a
Boost.MPL sequence of events, like boost::mpl::vector\<ErrorMode,
AnotherEvent\>) as interrupt state instead of terminate state, the state
machine will not handle any event other than the one which ends the
interrupt. So it\'s like a terminate state, with the difference that you
are allowed to resume the state machine when a condition (like handling
of the original error) is met.

<a id="basic-defer"></a>
Last but not least, this example also shows here the
handling of event deferring. Let\'s say someone puts a disc and
immediately presses play. The event cannot be handled, yet you\'d want
it to be handled at a later point and not force the user to press play
again. The solution is to define it as deferred in the Empty and Open
states and get it handled in the first state where the event is not to
be deferred. It can then be handled or rejected. In this example, when
Stopped becomes active, the event will be handled because only Empty and
Open defer the event.

UML defines event deferring as a state property. To accommodate this,
MSM lets you specify this in states by providing a `deferred_events`
type:

    struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> 
    {
       // if the play event is fired while in this state, defer it until a state
       // handles or rejects it
       typedef mpl::vector<play> deferred_events;
    ...
    };                 

Please have a look at the [complete
example](../examples/Orthogonal-deferred.cpp).

While this is wanted by UML and is simple, it is not always practical
because one could wish to defer only in certain conditions. One could
also want to make this be part of a transition action with the added
bonus of a guard for more sophisticated behaviors. It would also conform
to the MSM philosophy to get as much as possible in the transition
table, where you have the whole state machine structure. This is also
possible but not practical with this front-end so we will need to pick a
different row from the functor front-end. For a complete description of
the `Row` type, please have a look at the `functor front-end.`

First, as there is no state where MSM can automatically find out the
usage of this feature, we need to require deferred events capability
explicitly, by adding a type in the state machine definition:

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>
    { 
        typedef int activate_deferred_events;
    ...
    };                   

We can now defer an event in any transition of the transition table by
using as action the predefined `msm::front::Defer` functor, for example:

    Row < Empty , play , none , Defer , none >

This is an internal transition row (see `internal transitions`) but you
can ignore this for the moment. It just means that we are not leaving
the Empty state. What matters is that we use Defer as action. This is
roughly equivalent to the previous syntax but has the advantage of
giving you all the information in the transition table with the added
power of transition behavior.

The second difference is that as we now have a transition defined, this
transition can play in the resolution of `transition conflicts`. For
example, we could model an \"if (condition2) move to Playing else if
(condition1) defer play event\":

    Row   < Empty , play , none    , Defer , condition1   >,
    g_row < Empty , play , Playing , &player_::condition2 >

Please have a look at [this possible
implementation](../examples/Orthogonal-deferred2.cpp).

### History

UML defines two types of history, Shallow History and Deep History. In
the previous examples, if the player was playing the second song and the
user pressed pause, leaving Playing, at the next press on the play
button, the Playing state would become active and the first song would
play again. Soon would the first client complaints follow. They\'d of
course demand, that if the player was paused, then it should remember
which song was playing. But if the player was stopped, then it should
restart from the first song. How can it be done? Of course, you could
add a bit of programming logic and generate extra events to make the
second song start if coming from Pause. Something like:

    if (Event == end_pause) 
    { 
       for (int i=0;i< song number;++i) {player.process_event(NextSong()); } 
    } 

Not much to like in this example, isn\'t it? To solve this problem, you
define what is called a shallow or a deep history. A shallow history
reactivates the last active substate of a submachine when this
submachine becomes active again. The deep history does the same
recursively, so if this last active substate of the submachine was
itself a submachine, its last active substate would become active and
this will continue recursively until an active state is a normal state.
For example, let us have a look at the following UML diagram:

![](../images/HistoryTutorial.jpg)
Notice that the main difference compared to previous diagrams is that
the initial state is gone and replaced by a History symbol (the H inside
a circle).

As explained in the `small UML tutorial`, History is a good concept with
a not completely satisfying specification. MSM kept the concept but not
the specification and goes another way by making this a policy and you
can add your own history types (the [reference](#history-interface)
explains what needs to be done). Furthermore, History is a backend
policy. This allows you to reuse the same state machine definition with
different history policies in different contexts.

Concretely, your frontend stays unchanged:

    struct Playing_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<Playing_>

You then add the policy to the backend as second parameter:

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<Playing_,msm::back11::state_machine<player_>,
        msm::back::ShallowHistory<mpl::vector<end_pause> > > Playing;

This states that a shallow history must be activated if the Playing
state machine gets activated by the end_pause event and only this one
(or any other event added to the mpl::vector). If the state machine was
in the Stopped state and the event play was generated, the history would
not be activated and the normal initial state would become active. By
default, history is disabled. For your convenience the library provides
in addition to ShallowHistory a non-UML standard AlwaysHistory policy
(likely to be your main choice) which always activates history, whatever
event triggers the submachine activation. Deep history is not available
as a policy (but could be added). The reason is that it would conflict
with policies which submachines could define. Of course, if, for
example, Song1 were a state machine itself, it could use the
ShallowHistory policy itself thus creating Deep History for itself. An
[example](../examples/History.cpp) is also provided.

### Completion (anonymous) transitions

<a id="anonymous-transitions"></a>
The following diagram shows an example making
use of this feature:

![](../images/Anonymous.jpg)
Anonymous transitions are transitions without a named event. This means
that the transition automatically fires when the predecessor state is
entered (to be exact, after the entry action). Otherwise it is a normal
transition with actions and guards. Why would you need something like
that? A possible case would be if a part of your state machine
implements some algorithm, where states are steps of the algorithm
implementation. Then, using several anonymous transitions with different
guard conditions, you are actually implementing some if/else statement.
Another possible use would be a real-time system called at regular
intervals and always doing the same thing, meaning implementing the same
algorithm. The advantage is that once you know how long a transition
takes to execute on the system, by calculating the longest path (the
number of transitions from start to end), you can pretty much know how
long your algorithm will take in the worst case, which in turns tells
you how much of a time frame you are to request from a scheduler.

If you are using Executable UML (a good book describing it is
\"Executable UML, a foundation for Model-Driven Architecture\"), you
will notice that it is common for a state machine to generate an event
to itself only to force leaving a state. Anonymous transitions free you
from this constraint.

If you do not use this feature in a concrete state machine, MSM will
deactivate it and you will not pay for it. If you use it, there is
however a small performance penalty as MSM will try to fire a compound
event (the other UML name for anonymous transitions) after every taken
transition. This will therefore double the event processing cost, which
is not as bad as it sounds as MSM's execution speed is very high anyway.

To define such a transition, use "none" as event in the transition
table, for example:

    row < State3 , none , State4 , &p::State3ToState4 , &p::always_true >

[An implementation](../examples/AnonymousTutorial.cpp) of the state machine
diagram is also provided.

<a id="internal-transitions"></a>
### Internal transitions

Internal transitions are transitions executing in the scope of the
active state, a simple state or a submachine. One can see them as a
self-transition of this state, without an entry or exit action called.
This is useful when all you want is to execute some code for a given
event in a given state.

Internal transitions are specified as having a higher priority than
normal transitions. While it makes sense for a submachine with exit
points, it is surprising for a simple state. MSM lets you define the
transition priority by setting the transition's position inside the
transition table (see `internals`). The difference between \"normal\"
and internal transitions is that internal transitions have no target
state, therefore we need new row types. We had a_row, g_row, \_row and
row, we now add a_irow, g_irow, \_irow and irow which are like normal
transitions but define no target state. For example, an internal
transition with a guard condition could be:

    g_irow < Empty /*state*/,cd_detected/*event*/,&p::internal_guard/* guard */>

These new row types can be placed anywhere in the transition table so
that you can still have your state machine structure grouped together.
The only difference of behavior with the UML standard is the missing
notion of higher priority for internal transitions. Please have a look
at [the example](../examples/SimpleTutorialInternal.cpp).

It is also possible to do it the UML-conform way by declaring a
transition table called `internal transition_table` inside the state
itself and using internal row types. For example:

    struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> 
    {
        struct internal_transition_table : mpl::vector<
               a_internal < cd_detected , Empty, &Empty::internal_action >
        > {};
    };

This declares an internal transition table called
internal_transition_table and reacting on the event cd_detected by
calling internal_action on Empty. Let us note a few points:

-   Internal tables are NOT called transition_table but
    internal_transition_table.

-   They use different but similar row types: a_internal, g_internal,
    \_internal and internal.

-   These types take as first template argument the triggering event and
    then the action and guard method. Note that the only real difference
    to classical rows is the extra argument before the function pointer.
    This is the type on which the function will be called.

-   This also allows you, if you wish, to use actions and guards from
    another state of the state machine or in the state machine itself.

-   Submachines can have an internal transition table and a classical
    transition table.

The [following example](../examples/TestInternal.cpp) makes use of an
a_internal. It also uses functor-based internal transitions which will
be explained in `the functor front-end`, please ignore them for the
moment. Also note that the state-defined internal transitions, having
the highest priority (as mandated by the UML standard), are tried before
those defined inside the state machine transition table.

Which method should you use? It depends on what you need:

-   the first version (using irow) is simpler and likely to compile
    faster. It also lets you choose the priority of your internal
    transition.

-   the second version is more logical from a UML perspective and lets
    you make states more useful and reusable. It also allows you to call
    actions and guards on any state of the state machine.

<a id="internal-transitions-note"></a>
***Note***: There is an added possibility
coming from this feature. The `internal_transition_table` transitions
being added directly inside the main state machine\'s transition table,
it is possible, if it is more to your state, to distribute your state
machine definition a bit like Boost.Statechart, leaving to the state
machine itself the only task of declaring the states it wants to use
using the `explicit_creation` type definition. While this is not the
author\'s favorite way, it is still possible. A simplified example using
only two states will show this possibility:

-   [state machine
    definition](../examples/distributed_table/DistributedTable.cpp)

-   Empty [header](../examples/distributed_table/Empty.hpp) and
    [cpp](../examples/distributed_table/Empty.cpp)

-   Open [header](../examples/distributed_table/Open.hpp) and
    [cpp](../examples/distributed_table/Open.cpp)

-   [events definition](../examples/distributed_table/Events.hpp)

There is an added bonus offered for submachines, which can have both the
standard transition_table and an internal_transition_table (which has a
higher priority). This makes it easier if you decide to make a full
submachine from a state. It is also slightly faster than the standard
alternative, adding orthogonal regions, because event dispatching will,
if accepted by the internal table, not continue to the subregions. This
gives you an O(1) dispatch instead of O(number of regions). While the
example is with eUML, the same is also possible with any front-end.

<a id="basic-row2"></a>
### more row types

It is also possible to write transitions using actions and guards not
just from the state machine but also from its contained states. In this
case, one must specify not just a method pointer but also the object on
which to call it. This transition row is called, not very originally,
`row2`. They come, like normal transitions, in four flavors:
`a_row2, g_row2, _row2 and row2`. For example, a transition calling an
action from the state Empty could be:

    a_row2<Stopped,open_close,Open,Empty
          /*action source*/,&Empty::open_drawer/*action*/>

The same capabilities are also available for internal transitions so
that we have: `a_irow2, g_irow2, _irow2 and row2`. For transitions
defined as part of the `internal_transition_table`, you can use the
`a_internal, g_internal, _internal, internal` row types from the
previous sections.

These row types allow us to distribute the state machine code among
states, making them reusable and more useful. Using transition tables
inside states also contributes to this possibility. An
[example](../examples/SimpleTutorial2.cpp) of these new rows is also
provided.

### Explicit entry / entry and exit pseudo-state / fork

MSM (almost) fully supports these features, described in the
`small UML tutorial`. Almost because there are currently two
limitations:

-   it is only possible to explicitly enter a sub-state of the target
    but not a sub-sub-state.

-   it is not possible to explicitly exit. Exit points must be used.

Let us see a concrete example:

![](../images/entrytutorial.jpg)
We find in this diagram:

-   A "normal" activation of SubFsm2, triggered by event1. In each
    region, the initial state is activated, i.e. SubState1 and
    SubState1b.

-   An explicit entry into SubFsm2::SubState2 for region "1" with event2
    as trigger, meaning that in region "2" the initial state,
    SubState1b, activated.

-   A fork into regions "1" and "2" to the explicit entries SubState2
    and SubState2b, triggered by event3. Both states become active so no
    region is default activated (if we had a third one, it would be).

-   A connection of two transitions through an entry pseudo state,
    SubFsm2::PseudoEntry1, triggered by event4 and triggering also the
    second transition on the same event (both transitions must be
    triggered by the same event). Region "2" is default-activated and
    SubState1b becomes active.

-   An exit from SubFsm2 using an exit pseudo-state, PseudoExit1,
    triggered by event5 and connecting two transitions using the same
    event. Again, the event is forwarded to the second transition and
    both regions are exited, as SubFsm2 becomes inactive. Note that if
    no transition is defined from PseudoExit1, an error (as defined in
    the UML standard) will be detected and no_transition called.

The example is also [fully
implemented](../examples/DirectEntryTutorial.cpp).

This sounds complicated but the syntax is simple.

#### Explicit entry

First, to define that a state is an explicit entry, you have to make it
a state and mark it as explicit, giving as template parameters the
region id (the region id starts with 0 and corresponds to the first
initial state of the initial_state type sequence).

    struct SubFsm2_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<SubFsm2_> 
    {
       struct SubState2 : public msm::front::state<> , 
                          public msm::front::explicit_entry<0> 
       {...};
    ...
    };

And define the submachine as:

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<SubFsm2_> SubFsm2;

You can then use it as target in a transition with State1 as source:

    _row < State1, Event2, SubFsm2::direct< SubFsm2_::SubState2> > //SubFsm2_::SubState2: complete name of SubState2 (defined within SubFsm2_)

The syntax deserves some explanation. SubFsm2\_ is a front end.
SubState2 is a nested state, therefore the SubFsm2\_::SubState2 syntax.
The containing machine (containing State1 and SubFsm2) refers to the
backend instance (SubFsm2). SubFsm2::direct states that an explicit
entry is desired.

<a id="explicit-entry-no-region-id"></a>
Thanks to the `mpl_graph` library you
can also omit to provide the region index and let MSM find out for you.
There are however two points to note:

-   MSM can only find out the region index if the explicit entry state
    is somehow connected to an initial state through a transition, no
    matter the direction.

-   There is a compile-time cost for this feature.

*Note (also valid for forks)*: In order to make compile time more
bearable for the more standard cases, and unlike initial states,
explicit entry states which are also not found in the transition table
of the entered submachine (a rare case) do NOT get automatically
created. To explicitly create such states, you need to add in the state
machine containing the explicit states a simple typedef giving a
sequence of states to be explicitly created like:

    typedef mpl::vector<SubState2,SubState2b> explicit_creation;

*Note (also valid for forks)*: At the moment, it is not possible to use
a submachine as the target of an explicit entry. Please use entry pseudo
states for an almost identical effect.

#### Fork

Need a fork instead of an explicit entry? As a fork is an explicit entry
into states of different regions, we do not change the state definition
compared to the explicit entry and specify as target a list of explicit
entry states:

    _row < State1, Event3, 
            mpl::vector<SubFsm2::direct<SubFsm2_::SubState2>, 
            SubFsm2::direct <SubFsm2_::SubState2b>
         >

With SubState2 defined as before and SubState2b defined as being in the
second region (caution: MSM does not check that the region is correct):

    struct SubState2b : public msm::front::state<> , 
                        public msm::front::explicit_entry<1>

#### Entry pseudo states

To define an entry pseudo state, you need to derive from the
corresponding class and give the region id:

    struct PseudoEntry1 : public msm::front::entry_pseudo_state<0>

And add the corresponding transition in the top-level state machine\'s
transition table:

    _row < State1, Event4, SubFsm2::entry_pt<SubFsm2_::PseudoEntry1> >

And another in the SubFsm2\_ submachine definition (remember that UML
defines an entry point as a connection between two transitions), for
example this time with an action method:

    _row < PseudoEntry1, Event4, SubState3,&SubFsm2_::entry_action >

#### Exit pseudo states

And finally, exit pseudo states are to be used almost the same way, but
defined differently: it takes as template argument the event to be
forwarded (no region id is necessary):

    struct PseudoExit1 : public exit_pseudo_state<event6>

And you need, like for entry pseudo states, two transitions, one in the
submachine:

    _row < SubState3, Event5, PseudoExit1 >

And one in the containing state machine:

    _row < SubFsm2::exit_pt<SubFsm2_::PseudoExit1>, Event6,State2 >

*Important note 1:* UML defines transiting to an entry pseudo state and
having either no second transition or one with a guard as an error but
defines no error handling. MSM will tolerate this behavior; the entry
pseudo state will simply be the newly active state.

*Important note 2*: UML defines transiting to an exit pseudo state and
having no second transition as an error, and also defines no error
handling. Therefore, it was decided to implement exit pseudo state as
terminate states and the containing composite not properly exited will
stay terminated as it was technically "exited".

*Important note 3:* UML states that for the exit point, the same event
must be used in both transitions. MSM relaxes this rule and only wants
the event on the inside transition to be convertible to the one of the
outside transition. In our case, event6 is convertible from event5.
Notice that the forwarded event must be named in the exit point
definition. For example, we could define event6 as simply as:

    struct event 
    { 
        event(){} 
        template <class Event> 
        event(Event const&){} 
    }; //convertible from any event

*Note*: There is a current limitation if you need not only convert but
also get some data from the original event. Consider:

    struct event1 
    { 
        event1(int val_):val(val_) {}
        int val;
    }; // forwarded from exit point
    struct event2 
    { 
        template <class Event> 
        event2(Event const& e):val(e.val){} // compiler will complain about another event not having any val
        int val;
    }; // what the higher-level fsm wants to get

The solution is to provide two constructors:

    struct event2 
    { 
        template <class Event> 
        event2(Event const& ):val(0){} // will not be used
        event2(event1 const& e)):val(e.val){} // the conversion constructor
        int val;
    }; // what the higher-level fsm wants to get

### Flags

This [tutorial](../examples/Flags.cpp) is devoted to a concept not defined
in UML: flags. It has been added into MSM after proving itself useful on
many occasions. Please, do not be frightened as we are not talking about
ugly shortcuts made of an improbable collusion of Booleans.

If you look into the Boost.Statechart documentation you\'ll find this
code:

    if ( ( state_downcast< const NumLockOff * >() != 0 ) &&
         ( state_downcast< const CapsLockOff * >() != 0 ) &&
         ( state_downcast< const ScrollLockOff * >() != 0 ) )
                            

While correct and found in many UML books, this can be error-prone and a
potential time-bomb when your state machine grows and you add new states
or orthogonal regions.

And most of all, it hides the real question, which would be "does my
state machine\'s current state define a special property"? In this
special case "are my keys in a lock state"? So let\'s apply the
Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering and move one level of
abstraction higher.

In our player example, let\'s say we need to know if the player has a
loaded CD. We could do the same:

    if ( ( state_downcast< const Stopped * >() != 0 ) &&
         ( state_downcast< const Open * >() != 0 ) &&
         ( state_downcast< const Paused * >() != 0 ) &&
         ( state_downcast< const Playing * >() != 0 )) 

Or flag these 4 states as CDLoaded-able. You add a flag_list type into
each flagged state:

    typedef mpl::vector1<CDLoaded> flag_list;

You can even define a list of flags, for example in Playing:

    typedef mpl::vector2<PlayingPaused,CDLoaded> flag_list;

This means that Playing supports both properties. To check if your
player has a loaded CD, check if your flag is active in the current
state:

    player p; if (p.is_flag_active<CDLoaded>()) ... 

And what if you have orthogonal regions? How to decide if a state
machine is in a flagged state? By default, you keep the same code and
the current states will be OR\'ed, meaning if one of the active states
has the flag, then is_flag_active returns true. Of course, in some
cases, you might want that all of the active states are flagged for the
state to be active. You can also AND the active states:

    if (p.is_flag_active<CDLoaded,player::Flag_AND>()) ...

Note. Due to arcane C++ rules, when called inside an action, the correct
call is:

    if (p.template is_flag_active<CDLoaded>()) ...

The following diagram displays the flag situation in the tutorial.

![](../images/FlagsTutorial.jpg)

<a id="event-hierarchy"></a>
### Event Hierarchy

There are cases where one needs transitions based on categories of
events. An example is text parsing. Let\'s say you want to parse a
string and use a state machine to manage your parsing state. You want to
parse 4 digits and decide to use a state for every matched digit. Your
state machine could look like:

![](../images/ParsingDigits.jpg)
But how to detect the digit event? We would like to avoid defining 10
transitions on char_0, char_1\... between two states as it would force
us to write 4 x 10 transitions and the compile-time would suffer. To
solve this problem, MSM supports the triggering of a transition on a
subclass event. For example, if we define digits as:

    struct digit {};
    struct char_0 : public digit {}; 

And to the same for other digits, we can now fire char_0, char_1 events
and this will cause a transition with \"digit\" as trigger to be taken.

An [example](../examples/ParsingDigits.cpp) with performance measurement,
taken from the documentation of Boost.Xpressive illustrates this
example. You might notice that the performance is actually very good (in
this case even better).

### Customizing a state machine / Getting more speed

MSM is offering many UML features at a high-speed, but sometimes, you
just need more speed and are ready to give up some features in exchange.
A process_event is handling several tasks:

-   checking for terminate/interrupt states

-   handling the message queue (for entry/exit/transition actions
    generating themselves events)

-   handling deferred events

-   catching exceptions (or not)

-   handling the state switching and action calls

Of these tasks, only the last one is absolutely necessary to a state
machine (its core job), the other ones are nice-to-haves which cost CPU
time. In many cases, it is not so important, but in embedded systems,
this can lead to ad-hoc state machine implementations. MSM detects by
itself if a concrete state machine makes use of terminate/interrupt
states and deferred events and deactivates them if not used. For the
other two, if you do not need them, you need to help by indicating it in
your implementation. This is done with two simple typedefs:

-   `no_exception_thrown` indicates that behaviors will never throw and
    MSM does not need to catch anything.

-   `no_message_queue` indicates that no action will itself generate a
    new event and MSM can save us the message queue.

The third configuration possibility, explained [here](#basic-defer), is
to manually activate deferred events, using `activate_deferred_events`.
For example, the following state machine sets all three configuration
types:

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>
    {
       // no need for exception handling or message queue
       typedef int no_exception_thrown;
       typedef int no_message_queue;
       // also manually enable deferred events
       typedef int activate_deferred_events
       ...// rest of implementation
       };

*Important note*: As exit pseudo states are using the message queue to
forward events out of a submachine, the `no_message_queue` option cannot
be used with state machines containing an exit pseudo state.

### Choosing the initial event

A state machine is started using the `start` method. This causes the
initial state\'s entry behavior to be executed. Like every entry
behavior, it becomes as parameter the event causing the state to be
entered. But when the machine starts, there was no event triggered. In
this case, MSM sends `msm::back11::state_machine<...>::InitEvent`, which
might not be the default you\'d want. For this special case, MSM
provides a configuration mechanism in the form of a typedef. If the
state machine\'s front-end definition provides an initial_event typedef
set to another event, this event will be used. For example:

    struct my_initial_event{};
    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>{
    ...
    typedef my_initial_event initial_event; 
    };

### Containing state machine (deprecated)

This feature is still supported in MSM for backward compatibility but
made obsolete by the fact that every guard/action/entry action/exit
action gets the state machine passed as argument and might be removed at
a later time.

All of the states defined in the state machine are created upon state
machine construction. This has the huge advantage of a reduced syntactic
noise. The cost is a small loss of control for the user on the state
creation and access. But sometimes you needed a way for a state to get
access to its containing state machine. Basically, a state needs to
change its declaration to:

    struct Stopped : public msm::front::state<sm_ptr>

And to provide a set_sm_ptr function: `void set_sm_ptr(player* pl)`

to get a pointer to the containing state machine. The same applies to
terminate_state / interrupt_state and entry_pseudo_state /
exit_pseudo_state.

<a id="functor-front-end"></a>
## Functor front-end

The functor front-end is the preferred front-end at the moment. It is
more powerful than the standard front-end and has a more readable
transition table. It also makes it easier to reuse parts of state
machines. Like `eUML`, it also comes with a good deal of predefined
actions. Actually, eUML generates a functor front-end through
Boost.Typeof and Boost.Proto so both offer the same functionality.

The rows which MSM offered in the previous front-end come in different
flavors. We saw the a_row, g_row, \_row, row, not counting internal
rows. This is already much to know, so why define new rows? These types
have some disadvantages:

-   They are more typing and information than we would wish. This means
    syntactic noise and more to learn.

-   Function pointers are weird in C++.

-   The action/guard signature is limited and does not allow for more
    variations of parameters (source state, target state, current state
    machine, etc.).

-   It is not easy to reuse action code from a state machine to another.

### Transition table

We can change the definition of the simple tutorial\'s transition table
to:

     
    struct transition_table : mpl::vector<
    //    Start     Event        Target      Action                      Guard 
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    Row  < Stopped , play       ,  Playing  , start_playback            , none                       >,
    Row  < Stopped , open_close ,  Open     , open_drawer               , none                       >,
    Row  < Stopped , stop       ,  Stopped  , none                      , none                       >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    Row  < Open    , open_close ,  Empty    , close_drawer              , none                       >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    Row  < Empty   , open_close ,  Open     , open_drawer               , none                       >,
    Row  < Empty   , cd_detected,  Stopped  , store_cd_info             , good_disk_format           >,
    g_row< Empty   , cd_detected,  Playing  , &player_::store_cd_info   , &player_::auto_start       >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    Row  < Playing , stop       ,  Stopped  , stop_playback             , none                       >,
    Row  < Playing , pause      ,  Paused   , pause_playback            , none                       >,
    Row  < Playing , open_close ,  Open     , stop_and_open             , none                       >,
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    Row  < Paused  , end_pause  ,  Playing  , resume_playback           , none                       >,
    Row  < Paused  , stop       ,  Stopped  , stop_playback             , none                       >,
    Row  < Paused  , open_close ,  Open     , stop_and_open             , none                       >
    //   +---------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+ 
    > {};
                            

Transitions are now of type \"Row\" with exactly 5 template arguments:
source state, event, target state, action and guard. Wherever there is
nothing (for example actions and guards), write \"none\". Actions and
guards are no more methods but functors getting as arguments the
detected event, the state machine, source and target state:

    struct store_cd_info 
    { 
        template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState> 
        void operator()(Evt const&, Fsm& fsm, SourceState&,TargetState& ) 
        {
            cout << "player::store_cd_info" << endl;
            fsm.process_event(play());
        } 
    }; 

The advantage of functors compared to functions is that functors are
generic and reusable. They also allow passing more parameters than just
events. The guard functors are the same but have an operator() returning
a bool.

It is also possible to mix rows from different front-ends. To show this,
a g_row has been left in the transition table. *Note:* in case the
action functor is used in the transition table of a state machine
contained inside a top-level state machine, the "fsm" parameter refers
to the lowest-level state machine (referencing this action), not the
top-level one.

To illustrate the reusable point, MSM comes with a whole set of
predefined functors. Please refer to eUML for the [full
list](#Reference-begin). For example, we are now going to replace the
first action by an action sequence and the guard by a more complex
functor.

We decide we now want to execute two actions in the first transition
(Stopped -\> Playing). We only need to change the action start_playback
to

    ActionSequence_< mpl::vector<some_action, start_playback> >

and now will execute some_action and start_playback every time the
transition is taken. ActionSequence\_ is a functor calling each action
of the mpl::vector in sequence.

We also want to replace good_disk_format by a condition of the type:
"good_disk_format && (some_condition \|\| some_other_condition)". We can
achieve this using And\_ and Or\_ functors:

    And_<good_disk_format,Or_< some_condition , some_other_condition> >

It even starts looking like functional programming. MSM ships with
functors for operators, state machine usage, STL algorithms or container
methods.

### Defining states with entry/exit actions

You probably noticed that we just showed a different transition table
and that we even mixed rows from different front-ends. This means that
you can do this and leave the definitions for states unchanged. Most
examples are doing this as it is the simplest solution. You still enjoy
the simplicity of the first front-end with the extended power of the new
transition types. This [tutorial](../examples/SimpleWithFunctors.cpp),
adapted from the earlier example, does just this.

Of course, it is also possible to define states where entry and exit
actions are also provided as functors as these are generated by eUML and
both front-ends are equivalent. For example, we can define a state as:

    struct Empty_Entry 
    { 
        template <class Event,class Fsm,class State> 
        void operator()(Event const&,Fsm&,State&) 
        {
            ... 
        } 
    }; // same for Empty_Exit
    struct Empty_tag {};
    struct Empty : public msm::front::euml::func_state<Empty_tag,Empty_Entry,Empty_Exit>{};

This also means that you can, like in the transition table, write entry
/ exit actions made of more complicated action combinations. The
previous example can therefore [be
rewritten](../examples/SimpleWithFunctors2.cpp).

Usually, however, one will probably use the standard state definition as
it provides the same capabilities as this front-end state definition,
unless one needs some of the shipped predefined functors or is a fan of
functional programming.

<a id="functor-front-end-actions"></a>
### What do you actually do inside actions / guards (Part 2)?

Using the basic front-end, we saw how to pass data to actions through
the event, that data common to all states could be stored in the state
machine, state relevant data could be stored in the state and access as
template parameter in the entry / exit actions. What was however missing
was the capability to access relevant state data in the transition
action. This is possible with this front-end. A transition\'s source and
target state are also given as arguments. If the current calculation\'s
state was to be found in the transition\'s source state (whatever it
is), we could access it:

    struct send_rocket 
    { 
        template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState> 
        void operator()(Evt const&, Fsm& fsm, SourceState& src,TargetState& ) 
        {
            fire_rocket(evt.direction, src.current_calculation);
        } 
    }; 

It was a little awkward to generate new events inside actions with the
basic front-end. With the functor front-end it is much cleaner:

    struct send_rocket 
    { 
        template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState> 
        void operator()(Evt const& evt, Fsm& fsm, SourceState& src,TargetState&) 
        {
            fire_rocket(evt.direction, src.current_calculation);
            fsm.process_event(rocket_launched());
        } 
    }; 

### Defining a simple state machine

Like states, state machines can be defined using the previous front-end,
as the previous example showed, or with the functor front-end, which
allows you to define state machine entry and exit functions as functors,
as in [this example](../examples/SimpleWithFunctors2.cpp).

### Anonymous transitions

Anonymous (completion) transitions are transitions without a named
event. We saw how this front-end uses `none` when no action or guard is
required. We can also use `none` instead of an event to mark an
anonymous transition. For example, the following transition makes an
immediate transition from State1 to State2:

    Row < State1 , none , State2 >

The following transition does the same but calling an action in the
process:

    Row < State1 , none , State2 , State1ToState2, none >

The following diagram shows an example and its
[implementation](../examples/AnonymousTutorialWithFunctors.cpp):

![](../images/Anonymous.jpg)

<a id="functor-internal-transitions"></a>
### Internal transitions

The [following example](../examples/SimpleTutorialInternalFunctors.cpp)
uses internal transitions with the functor front-end. As for the simple
standard front-end, both methods of defining internal transitions are
supported:

-   providing a `Row` in the state machine\'s transition table with
    `none` as target state defines an internal transition.

-   providing an `internal_transition_table` made of `Internal` rows
    inside a state or submachine defines UML-conforming internal
    transitions with higher priority.

-   transitions defined inside `internal_transition_table` require no
    source or target state as the source state is known (`Internal`
    really are `Row` without a source or target state).

Like for the `standard front-end internal transitions`, internal
transition tables are added into the main state machine\'s table, thus
allowing you to distribute the transition table definition and reuse
states.

There is an added bonus offered for submachines, which can have both the
standard transition_table and an internal_transition_table (which has
higher priority). This makes it easier if you decide to make a full
submachine from a state later. It is also slightly faster than the
standard alternative, adding orthogonal regions, because event
dispatching will, if accepted by the internal table, not continue to the
subregions. This gives you an O(1) dispatch instead of O(number of
regions). While the example is with eUML, the same is also possible with
this front-end.

<a id="any-event"></a>
### Kleene (any) event

Normally, MSM requires an event to fire a transition. But there are
cases, where any event, no matter which one, would do:

-   If you want to reduce the number of transitions: any event would do,
    possibly will guards decide what happens.

-   Pseudo entry states do not necessarily want to know the event which
    caused their activation, or they might want to know only a property
    of it.

MSM supports a boost::any as an acceptable event. This event will match
any event, meaning that if a transition with boost::any as event
originates from the current state, this transition would fire (provided
no guards or transition with a higher priority fires first). This event
is named Kleene, as a reference to the Kleene star used in a regex.

For example, this transition on a state machine instance named fsm:

    Row < State1, boost::any, State2>

will fire if State1 is active and an event is processed:

    fsm.process_event(whatever_event());

At this point, you can use this *any* event in transition actions to get
back to the original event by calling for example *boost::any::type()*.

It is also possible to support your own Kleene events by specializing
boost::msm::is_kleene_event for a given event, for example:

    namespace boost { namespace msm{
        template<> 
        struct is_kleene_event< my_event >
        { 
          typedef boost::mpl::true_ type;
        };
    }}

The only requirement is that this event must have a copy constructor
from the event originally processed on the state machine.

## PUML (C++-20), experimental

### PlantUML basics

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a modelling tool with a nice
extension for state machine diagrams. The result can then be viewed, for
example VSCode has add-ons for previewing the result.

Our usual player example could look like this in PlantUML syntax:

    @startuml Player
                skinparam linetype polyline
                state Player{
                    [*]-> Empty
                    Stopped     -> Playing   : play 
                    Stopped     -> Open      : open_close    / open_drawer
                    Stopped     -> Stopped   : stop

                    Open        -> Empty     : open_close    / close_drawer               [can_close_drawer]
                    Empty       --> Open     : open_close    / open_drawer
                    Empty       ---> Stopped : cd_detected   / store_cd_info              [good_disk_format && always_true]
                    Playing     --> Stopped  : stop          / stop_playback
                    Playing     -> Paused    : pause
                    Playing     --> Open     : open_close    / stop_playback, open_drawer
                    Paused      -> Playing   : end_pause     / resume_playback
                    Paused      --> Stopped  : stop          / stop_playback
                    Paused      --> Open     : open_close    / stop_playback, open_drawer

                    Playing : flag CDLoaded
                    Playing : entry start_playback [always_true]
                    Paused  : entry pause_playback
                    Paused  : flag CDLoaded
                    Stopped : flag CDLoaded                
                }
     @enduml

A few key points of the syntax:

-   Initial states are marked with \[\*\] -\> State

-   Terminal states are marked with Terminal -\> \[\*\]

-   Transitions follow the syntax: Source State -\> Target State : event
    / Action1,Action2 \[guard conditions\]

-   Varying the number of \"-\" will make the layouter use longer arrows
    for transitions

-   \"\--\" will make orthogonal regions clearer

-   Supported guard conditions are guard names &&\... \|\|\... !\... (),
    for example !G1 && (G2 \|\| G3)

We also want to add these non-standard PlantUML features:

-   Flags. State Name : \[keyword\] flag flag-name. Add a flag per line.

-   entry / exit actions. State name: \[keyword\] entry-or-exit
    comma-separated-actions-sequence \[guard conditions\]

-   An anonymous transition has an empty event name

-   An any event is defined using the Kleene syntax \"\*\" as the event
    name.

-   a defer function is already provided for conditional event deferring

-   an internal transition is implemented using an equal source and
    target state and a \"-\" before the event name

        Open        -> Open         : -play         / defer

-   An internal Kleene would then be:

        Empty       -> Empty        : -*            / defer               [is_play_event]

Before PUML one had to convert this syntax in the classical MSM
transition table, states with entry/exit/flags, events, etc. which takes
long and is error-prone.

Good news: This is no more necessary. Now we can copy-paste our PlantUML
and directly use it in the code, which gives us:

        // front-end: define the FSM structure 
        struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>
        {
            // here is the whole FSM structure defined:
            // Initial states [*]
            // Transitions with actions starting with / and separated by ,
            // and guards between [ ]. Supported are !, &&, || and ()
            // State Entry / Exit with guards
            // Flags
            // -> can have different lengths for nicer PlantUML Viewer preview

            BOOST_MSM_PUML_DECLARE_TABLE(
                R"( 
                @startuml Player
                skinparam linetype polyline
                state Player{
                    [*]-> Empty
                    Stopped     -> Playing   : play 
                    Stopped     -> Open      : open_close    / open_drawer
                    Stopped     -> Stopped   : stop

                    Open        -> Empty     : open_close    / close_drawer               [can_close_drawer]
                    Empty       --> Open     : open_close    / open_drawer
                    Empty       ---> Stopped : cd_detected   / store_cd_info              [good_disk_format && always_true]
                    Playing     --> Stopped  : stop          / stop_playback
                    Playing     -> Paused    : pause
                    Playing     --> Open     : open_close    / stop_playback, open_drawer
                    Paused      -> Playing   : end_pause     / resume_playback
                    Paused      --> Stopped  : stop          / stop_playback
                    Paused      --> Open     : open_close    / stop_playback, open_drawer

                    Playing : flag CDLoaded
                    Playing : entry start_playback [always_true]
                    Paused  : entry pause_playback
                    Paused  : flag CDLoaded
                    Stopped : flag CDLoaded                
                }
                @enduml
            )"
            )

            // Replaces the default no-transition response.
            template <class FSM, class Event>
            void no_transition(Event const&, FSM&, int)
            {
            }
        };
        // Pick a back-end
        typedef msm::back11::state_machine<player_> player;

The PlantUML string is parsed at compile-time and generates a classical
Functor front-end.

States and event do not need to be defined any more, unless one needs to
provide them with attributes, or if the states are submachines. Actions
and Guards do need to be implemented to reduce bugs because of typos:

    namespace boost::msm::front::puml {
        template<>
        struct Action<by_name("close_drawer")>
        {
            template <class EVT, class FSM, class SourceState, class TargetState>
            void operator()(EVT const&, FSM&, SourceState&, TargetState&)
            {
            }
        };
        template<>
        struct Guard<by_name("always_true")>
        {
            template <class EVT, class FSM, class SourceState, class TargetState>
            bool operator()(EVT const&, FSM&, SourceState&, TargetState&)
            {
                return true;
            }
        };    
        }

The events are also referenced by name:

    p.process_event(Event<by_name("open_close")>{});                        
                        

Please note that C++-20 is required. [A complete
implementation](../examples/SimplePuml.cpp) of the player is provided.

### Composite State Machines

At the moment, the PUML front-end does not support submachines in a
single text string, so we need to split. First we define the submachine:

    struct playing_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<playing_>
    {
            typedef boost::fusion::vector<PlayingPaused, CDLoaded>        flag_list;
            // optional
            template <class Event, class FSM>
            void on_entry(Event const&, FSM&) { }
            template <class Event, class FSM>
            void on_exit(Event const&, FSM&) { }

            BOOST_MSM_PUML_DECLARE_TABLE(
                R"( 
                @startuml Player
                skinparam linetype polyline
                state Player{
                    [*]-> Song1
                    Song1     -> Song2   : NextSong         
                    Song2     -> Song1   : PreviousSong   / start_prev_song [start_prev_song_guard]
                    Song2     -> Song3   : NextSong       / start_next_song
                    Song3     -> Song2   : PreviousSong                     [start_prev_song_guard]
                }
                @enduml
            )"
            )

            // Replaces the default no-transition response.
            template <class FSM, class Event>
            void no_transition(Event const&, FSM&, int)
            {
            }
    };                    
    namespace boost::msm::front::puml {
        // define submachine with desired back-end
        template<>
        struct State<by_name("PlayingFsm")> : public msm::back11::state_machine<playing_>
        {
        };
    }
                    

We can reference the submachine within the upper state machine:

    PlayingFsm  --> Stopped       : stop          / stop_playback

Again, [a complete implementation](../examples/OrthogonalDeferredPuml.cpp)
of the player is provided. Interesting are the orthogonal regions
delimited with \"\--\", comments and the possibility to declare
terminate or interrupt state using the standard MSM states.

<a id="eUML-front-end"></a>
## eUML

*Important note*: eUML is not further under development and will be
gradually replaced by Puml with PlantUML syntax.

*Important note*: eUML requires a compiler supporting Boost.Typeof. Full
eUML has experimental status (but not if only the transition table is
written using eUML) because some compilers will start crashing when a
state machine becomes too big (usually when you write huge actions).

The previous front-ends are simple to write but still force an amount of
noise, mostly MPL types, so it would be nice to write code looking like
C++ (with a C++ action language) directly inside the transition table,
like UML designers like to do on their state machine diagrams. If it
were functional programming, it would be even better. This is what eUML
is for.

eUML is a Boost.Proto and Boost.Typeof-based compile-time domain
specific embedded language. It provides grammars which allow the
definition of actions/guards directly inside the transition table or
entry/exit in the state definition. There are grammars for actions,
guards, flags, attributes, deferred events, initial states.

It also relies on Boost.Typeof as a wrapper around the new decltype
C++0x feature to provide a compile-time evaluation of all the grammars.
Unfortunately, all the underlying Boost libraries are not
Typeof-enabled, so for the moment, you will need a compiler where Typeof
is supported (like VC9-10, g++ \>= 4.3).

Examples will be provided in the next paragraphs. You need to include
eUML basic features:

    #include <msm/front/euml/euml.hpp>

To add STL support (at possible cost of longer compilation times),
include:

    #include <msm/front/euml/stl.hpp>

eUML is defined in the namespace `msm::front::euml`.

### Transition table

A transition can be defined using eUML as:

    source + event [guard] / action == target

or as

    target == source + event [guard] / action

The first version looks like a drawn transition in a diagram, the second
one seems natural to a C++ developer.

The simple transition table written with the `functor front-end` can now
be written as:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE(( 
    Stopped + play [some_guard] / (some_action , start_playback)  == Playing ,
    Stopped + open_close/ open_drawer                             == Open    ,
    Stopped + stop                                                == Stopped ,
    Open    + open_close / close_drawer                           == Empty   ,
    Empty   + open_close / open_drawer                            == Open    ,
    Empty   + cd_detected [good_disk_format] / store_cd_info      == Stopped
    ),transition_table)                       

Or, using the alternative notation, it can be:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE(( 
    Playing  == Stopped + play [some_guard] / (some_action , start_playback) ,
    Open     == Stopped + open_close/ open_drawer                            ,
    Stopped  == Stopped + stop                                               ,
    Empty    == Open    + open_close / close_drawer                          ,
    Open     == Empty   + open_close / open_drawer                           ,
    Stopped  == Empty   + cd_detected [good_disk_format] / store_cd_info
    ),transition_table)           

The transition table now looks like a list of (readable) rules with
little noise.

UML defines guards between "\[ \]" and actions after a "/", so the
chosen syntax is already more readable for UML designers. UML also
allows designers to define several actions sequentially (our previous
ActionSequence\_) separated by a comma. The first transition does just
this: two actions separated by a comma and enclosed inside parenthesis
to respect C++ operator precedence.

If this seems to you like it will cost you run-time performance, don\'t
worry, eUML is based on typeof (or decltype) which only evaluates the
parameters to BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE and no run-time cost
occurs. Actually, eUML is only a metaprogramming layer on top of
\"standard\" MSM metaprogramming and this first layer generates the
previously-introduced `functor front-end`.

UML also allows designers to define more complicated guards, like
\[good_disk_format && (some_condition \|\| some_other_condition)\]. This
was possible with our previously defined functors, but using a
complicated template syntax. This syntax is now possible exactly as
written, which means without any syntactic noise at all.

### A simple example: rewriting only our transition table

As an introduction to eUML, we will rewrite our tutorial\'s transition
table using eUML. This will require two or three changes, depending on
the compiler:

-   events must inherit from msm::front::euml::euml_event\< event_name
    \>

-   states must inherit from msm::front::euml::euml_state\< state_name
    \>

-   with VC, states must be declared before the front-end

We now can write the transition table like just shown, using
BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_TRANSITION_TABLE instead of
BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE. The
[implementation](../examples/SimpleTutorialWithEumlTable.cpp) is pretty
straightforward. The only required addition is the need to declare a
variable for each state or add parenses (a default-constructor call) in
the transition table.

The [
`composite<a id="eUML-composite-table"></a>](../examples/CompositeTutorialWithEumlTable.cpp)
implementation is also natural:

    // front-end like always
    struct sub_front_end : public boost::msm::front::state_machine_def<sub_front_end>
    {
    ...
    };
    // back-end like always
    typedef boost::msm::back11::state_machine<sub_front_end> sub_back_end;

    sub_back_end const sub; // sub can be used in a transition table.

Unfortunately, there is a bug with VC, which appears from time to time
and causes a stack overflow. If you get a warning that the program is
recursive on all paths, revert to either standard eUML or another
front-end as Microsoft doesn\'t seem to intend to fix it.

We now have a new, more readable transition table with few changes to
our example. eUML can do much more so please follow the guide.

### Defining events, actions and states with entry/exit actions

#### Events

Events must be proto-enabled. To achieve this, they must inherit from a
proto terminal (euml_event\<event-name\>). eUML also provides a macro to
make this easier:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT(play)

This declares an event type and an instance of this type called `play`,
which is now ready to use in state or transition behaviors.

There is a second macro, BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES, which
takes as second parameter the attributes an event will contain, using
the `attribute syntax`.

*Note*: as we now have events defined as instances instead of just
types, can we still process an event by creating one on the fly, like:
`fsm.process_event(play());` or do we have to write:
`fsm.process_event(play);`

The answer is you can do both. The second one is easier but unlike other
front-ends, the second uses a defined operator(), which creates an event
on the fly.

#### Actions

Actions (returning void) and guards (returning a bool) are defined like
previous functors, with the difference that they also must be
proto-enabled. This can be done by inheriting from euml_action\<
functor-name \>. eUML also provides a macro:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_ACTION(some_condition)
    {
        template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState>
        bool operator()(Evt const& ,Fsm& ,SourceState&,TargetState& ) 
        { return true; }
    }; 

Like for events, this macro declares a functor type and an instance for
use in transition or state behaviors.

It is possible to use the same action grammar from the transition table
to define state entry and exit behaviors. So `(action1,action2)` is a
valid entry or exit behavior executing both actions in turn.

The state functors have a slightly different signature as there is no
source and target state but only a current state (entry/exit actions are
transition-independent), for example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_ACTION(Empty_Entry)
    {
        template <class Evt,class Fsm,class State>
        void operator()(Evt const& ,Fsm& ,State& ) { ... }                           
        }; 

<a id="eUML-reuse-functor"></a>
It is also possible to reuse the functors from
the functor front-end. The syntax is however slightly less comfortable
as we need to pretend creating one on the fly for typeof. For example:

    struct start_playback 
    {
            template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState>
            void operator()(Evt const& ,Fsm&,SourceState& ,TargetState& )
            {
             ...            
            }
    };
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE((
    Playing   == Stopped  + play        / start_playback() ,
    ...
    ),transition_table)

#### States

There is also a macro for states. This macro has 2 arguments, first the
expression defining the state, then the state (instance) name:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE((),Paused)

This defines a simple state without entry or exit action. You can
provide in the expression parameter the state behaviors (entry and exit)
using the action grammar, like in the transition table:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE(((Empty_Entry,Dummy_Entry)/*2 entryactions*/,
                           Empty_Exit/*1 exit action*/ ),
                         Empty)

This means that Empty is defined as a state with an entry action made of
two sub-actions, Empty_Entry and Dummy_Entry (enclosed inside
parenthesis), and an exit action, Empty_Exit.

There are several possibilities for the <a id="eUML-build-state"></a> expression
syntax:

-   (): state without entry or exit action.

-   (Expr1): state with entry but no exit action.

-   (Expr1,Expr2): state with entry and exit action.

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes): state with entry and exit action, defining
    some attributes (read further on).

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes,Configure): state with entry and exit
    action, defining some attributes (read further on) and flags
    (standard MSM flags) or deferred events (standard MSM deferred
    events).

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes,Configure,Base): state with entry and exit
    action, defining some attributes (read further on), flags and
    deferred events (plain msm deferred events) and a non-default base
    state (as defined in standard MSM).

no_action is also defined, which does, well, nothing except being a
placeholder (needed for example as entry action if we have no entry but
an exit). Expr1 and Expr2 are a sequence of actions, obeying the same
action grammar as in the transition table (following the "/" symbol).

The BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE macro will allow you to define most common
states, but sometimes you will need more, for example provide in your
states some special behavior. In this case, you will have to do the
macro\'s job by hand, which is not very complicated. The state will need
to inherit from `msm::front::state<>`, like any state, and from
`euml_state<state-name>` to be proto-enabled. You will then need to
declare an instance for use in the transition table. For example:

    struct Empty_impl : public msm::front::state<> , public euml_state<Empty_impl> 
    {
       void activate_empty() {std::cout << "switching to Empty " << std::endl;}
       template <class Event,class Fsm>
       void on_entry(Event const& evt,Fsm&fsm){...}
       template <class Event,class Fsm>
       void on_exit(Event const& evt,Fsm&fsm){...}
    };
    //instance for use in the transition table
    Empty_impl const Empty;

Notice also that we defined a method named activate_empty. We would like
to call it inside a behavior. This can be done using the
BOOST_MSM_EUML_METHOD macro.

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_METHOD(ActivateEmpty_,activate_empty,activate_empty_,void,void)

The first parameter is the name of the underlying functor, which you
could use with the functor front-end, the second is the state method
name, the third is the eUML-generated function, the fourth and fifth the
return value when used inside a transition or a state behavior. You can
now use this inside a transition:

    Empty == Open + open_close / (close_drawer,activate_empty_(target_))

### Wrapping up a simple state machine and first complete examples

You can reuse the state machine definition method from the standard
front-end and simply replace the transition table by this new one. You
can also use eUML to define a state machine \"on the fly\" (if, for
example, you need to provide an on_entry/on_exit for this state machine
as a functor). For this, there is also a macro,

<a id="eUML-build-sm"></a>
BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE, which has 2
arguments, an expression describing the state machine and the state
machine name. The expression has up to 8 arguments:

-   (Stt, Init): simplest state machine where only the transition table
    and initial state(s) are defined.

-   (Stt, Init, Expr1): state machine where the transition table,
    initial state and entry action are defined.

-   (Stt, Init, Expr1, Expr2): state machine where the transition table,
    initial state, entry and exit actions are defined.

-   (Stt, Init, Expr1, Expr2, Attributes): state machine where the
    transition table, initial state, entry and exit actions are defined.
    Furthermore, some attributes are added (read further on).

-   (Stt, Init, Expr1, Expr2, Attributes, Configure): state machine
    where the transition table, initial state, entry and exit actions
    are defined. Furthermore, some attributes (read further on), flags,
    deferred events and [configuration
    capabilities](#eUML-Configuration) (no message queue / no exception
    catching) are added.

-   (Stt, Init, Expr1, Expr2, Attributes, Flags, Deferred , Base): state
    machine where the transition table, initial state, entry and exit
    actions are defined. Furthermore, attributes (read further on),
    flags, deferred events and configuration capabilities (no message
    queue / no exception catching) are added and a non-default base
    state (see the [back-end description](#backend-base-state)) is
    defined.

For example, a minimum state machine could be defined as:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE(( 
    ),transition_table)                       

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE((transition_table,init_ << Empty ),
                                         player_)

Please have a look at the player tutorial written using eUML\'s [first
syntax](../examples/SimpleTutorialEuml2.cpp) and [second
syntax](../examples/SimpleTutorialEuml.cpp). The
BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE macro, to which we will get back
shortly, declares attributes given to an eUML type (state or event)
using the `attribute syntax`.

### Defining a submachine

Defining a submachine (see
[tutorial](../examples/CompositeTutorialEuml.cpp)) with other front-ends
simply means using a state which is a state machine in the transition
table of another state machine. This is the same with eUML. One only
needs to define a second state machine and reference it in the
transition table of the containing state machine.

Unlike the state or event definition macros,
BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE defines a type, not an instance
because a type is what the back-end requires. This means that you will
need to declare yourself an instance to reference your submachine into
another state machine, for example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE(...,Playing_)
    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<Playing_> Playing_type;
    Playing_type const Playing;

We can now use this instance inside the transition table of the
containing state machine:

    Paused == Playing + pause / pause_playback

<a id="eUML-attributes"></a>
### Attributes / Function call

We now want to make our grammar more useful. Very often, one needs only
very simple action methods, for example ++Counter or Counter \> 5 where
Counter is usually defined as some attribute of the class containing the
state machine. It seems like a waste to write a functor for such a
simple action. Furthermore, states within MSM are also classes so they
can have attributes, and we would also like to provide them with
attributes.

If you look back at our examples using the
[first](../examples/SimpleTutorialEuml2.cpp) and
[second](../examples/SimpleTutorialEuml.cpp) syntaxes, you will find a
BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE and a BOOST_MSM_EUML_ATTRIBUTES macro.
The first one declares possible attributes:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE(std::string,cd_name)
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE(DiskTypeEnum,cd_type)

This declares two attributes: cd_name of type std::string and cd_type of
type DiskTypeEnum. These attributes are not part of any event or state
in particular, we just declared a name and a type. Now, we can add
attributes to our cd_detected event using the second one:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_ATTRIBUTES((attributes_ << cd_name << cd_type ), 
                              cd_detected_attributes)

This declares an attribute list which is not linked to anything in
particular yet. It can be attached to a state or an event. For example,
if we want the event cd_detected to have these defined attributes we
write:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES(cd_detected,cd_detected_attributes)

For states, we use the BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE macro, which has an
expression form where one can provide attributes. For example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE((no_action /*entry*/,no_action/*exit*/,
                          attributes_ << cd_detected_attributes),
                         some_state)

OK, great, we now have a way to add attributes to a class, which we
could have done more easily, so what is the point? The point is that we
can now reference these attributes directly, at compile-time, in the
transition table. For example, in the example, you will find this
transition:

    Stopped==Empty+cd_detected[good_disk_format&&(event_(cd_type)==Int_<DISK_CD>())] 

Read event\_(cd_type) as event\_-\>cd_type with event\_ a type generic
for events, whatever the concrete event is (in this particular case, it
happens to be a cd_detected as the transition shows).

The main advantage of this feature is that you do not need to define a
new functor and you do not need to look inside the functor to know what
it does, you have all at hand.

MSM provides more generic objects for state machine types:

-   event\_: used inside any action, the event triggering the transition

-   state\_: used inside entry and exit actions, the entered / exited
    state

-   source\_: used inside a transition action, the source state

-   target\_: used inside a transition action, the target state

-   fsm\_: used inside any action, the (lowest-level) state machine
    processing the transition

-   Int\_\<int value\>: a functor representing an int

-   Char\_\<value\>: a functor representing a char

-   Size_t\_\<value\>: a functor representing a size_t

-   String\_\<mpl::string\> (boost \>= 1.40): a functor representing a
    string.

These helpers can be used in two different ways:

-   helper(attribute_name) returns the attribute with name
    attribute_name

-   helper returns the state / event type itself.

The second form is helpful if you want to provide your states with their
own methods, which you also want to use inside the transition table. In
the [above tutorial](../examples/SimpleTutorialEuml.cpp), we provide Empty
with an activate_empty method. We would like to create an eUML functor
and call it from inside the transition table. This is done using the
MSM_EUML_METHOD / MSM_EUML_FUNCTION macros. The first creates a functor
to a method, the second to a free function. In the tutorial, we write:

    MSM_EUML_METHOD(ActivateEmpty_,activate_empty,activate_empty_,void,void)

The first parameter is the functor name, for use with the functor
front-end. The second is the name of the method to call. The third is
the function name for use with eUML, the fourth is the return type of
the function if used in the context of a transition action, the fifth is
the result type if used in the context of a state entry / exit action
(usually fourth and fifth are the same). We now have a new eUML function
calling a method of \"something\", and this \"something\" is one of the
five previously shown generic helpers. We can now use this in a
transition, for example:

    Empty == Open + open_close / (close_drawer,activate_empty_(target_))

The action is now defined as a sequence of two actions: close_drawer and
activate_empty, which is called on the target itself. The target being
Empty (the state defined left), this really will call
Empty::activate_empty(). This method could also have an (or several)
argument(s), for example the event, we could then call
activate_empty\_(target\_ , event\_).

More examples can be found in the [terrible compiler stress
test](../examples/CompilerStressTestEuml.cpp), the [timer
example](../examples/SimpleTimer.cpp) or in the [iPodSearch with
eUML](../examples/iPodSearchEuml.cpp) (for String\_ and more).

### Orthogonal regions, flags, event deferring

Defining orthogonal regions really means providing more initial states.
To add more initial states, "shift left" some, for example, if we had
another initial state named AllOk:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE((transition_table,
                                         init_ << Empty << AllOk ),
                                        player_)

You remember from the `BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE` and
`BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE` signatures that just after
attributes, we can define flags, like in the basic MSM front-end. To do
this, we have another \"shift-left\" grammar, for example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE((no_action,no_action, attributes_ <<no_attributes_, 
                          /* flags */ configure_<< PlayingPaused << CDLoaded), 
                        Paused)

We now defined that Paused will get two flags, PlayingPaused and
CDLoaded, defined, with another macro:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG(CDLoaded)

This corresponds to the following basic front-end definition of Paused:

    struct Paused : public msm::front::state<>
    { 
       typedef mpl::vector2<PlayingPaused,CDLoaded> flag_list; 
    };

Under the hood, what you get really is a mpl::vector2.

*Note*: As we use the version of BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE\'s expression with
4 arguments, we need to tell eUML that we need no attributes. Similarly
to a `cout << endl`, we need an `attributes_ << no_attributes_` syntax.

You can use the flag with the is_flag_active method of a state machine.
You can also use the provided helper function is_flag\_ (returning a
bool) for state and transition behaviors. For example, in the [iPod
implementation with eUML](../examples/iPodEuml.cpp), you find the following
transition:

    ForwardPressed == NoForward + EastPressed[!is_flag_(NoFastFwd)]

The function also has an optional second parameter which is the state
machine on which the function is called. By default, fsm\_ is used (the
current state machine) but you could provide a functor returning a
reference to another state machine.

eUML also supports defining deferred events in the state (state machine)
definition. To this aim, we can reuse the flag grammar. For example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE((Empty_Entry,Empty_Exit, attributes_ << no_attributes_,
                          /* deferred */ configure_<< play ),Empty) 

The configure\_ left shift is also responsible for deferring events.
Shift inside configure\_ a flag and the state will get a flag, shift an
event and it will get a deferred event. This replaces the basic
front-end definition:

    typedef mpl::vector<play> deferred_events;

In [this tutorial](../examples/OrthogonalDeferredEuml.cpp), player is
defining a second orthogonal region with AllOk as initial state. The
`Empty` and `Open` states also defer the event `play`. `Open`, `Stopped`
and `Pause` also support the flag `CDLoaded` using the same left shift
into `configure_`.

In the functor front-end, we also had the possibility to defer an event
inside a transition, which makes possible conditional deferring. This is
also possible with eUML through the use of the defer\_ order, as shown
in [this tutorial](../examples/OrthogonalDeferredEuml.cpp). You will find
the following transition:

    Open + play / defer_

This is an `internal transition`. Ignore it for the moment. Interesting
is, that when the event `play` is fired and `Open` is active, the event
will be deferred. Now add a guard and you can conditionally defer the
event, for example:

    Open + play [ some_condition ] / defer_

This is similar to what we did with the functor front-end. This means
that we have the same constraints. Using defer\_ instead of a state
declaration, we need to tell MSM that we have deferred events in this
state machine. We do this (again) using a configure\_ declaration in the
state machine definition in which we shift the deferred_events
configuration flag:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE((transition_table,
                                          init_ << Empty << AllOk,
                                          Entry_Action, 
                                          Exit_Action, 
                                          attributes_ << no_attributes_,
                                          configure_<< deferred_events ),
                                        player_)

A [tutorial](../examples/OrthogonalDeferredEuml2.cpp) illustrates this
possibility.

<a id="eUML-Configuration"></a>
### Customizing a state machine / Getting more speed

We just saw how to use configure\_ to define deferred events or flags.
We can also use it to configure our state machine like we did with the
other front-ends:

-   `configure_ << no_exception`: disables exception handling

-   `configure_ << no_msg_queue` deactivates the message queue

-   `configure_ << deferred_events` manually enables event deferring

Deactivating the first two features and not activating the third if not
needed greatly improves the event dispatching speed of your state
machine. Our [speed testing](../examples/EumlSimple.cpp) example with eUML
does this for the best performance.

*Important note*: As exit pseudo states are using the message queue to
forward events out of a submachine, the `no_message_queue` option cannot
be used with state machines containing an exit pseudo state.

### Completion / Anonymous transitions

Anonymous transitions (see `UML tutorial`) are transitions without a
named event, which are therefore triggered immediately when the source
state becomes active, provided a guard allows it. As there is no event,
to define such a transition, simply omit the "+" part of the transition
(the event), for example:

    State3 == State4 [always_true] / State3ToState4
    State4 [always_true] / State3ToState4 == State3

Please have a look at [this
example](../examples/AnonymousTutorialEuml.cpp), which implements the
`previously defined` state machine with eUML.

<a id="eUML-internal"></a>
### Internal transitions

Like both other front-ends, eUML supports two ways of defining internal
transitions:

-   in the state machine\'s transition table. In this case, you need to
    specify a source state, event, actions and guards but no target
    state, which eUML will interpret as an internal transition, for
    example this defines a transition internal to Open, on the event
    open_close:

        Open + open_close [internal_guard1] / internal_action1

    [A full example](../examples/EumlInternal.cpp) is also provided.

-   in a state\'s `internal_transition_table`. For example:

        BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE((Open_Entry,Open_Exit),Open_def)
        struct Open_impl : public Open_def
        {
           BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_INTERNAL_TRANSITION_TABLE((
                open_close [internal_guard1] / internal_action1
           ))
        };

    Notice how we do not need to repeat that the transition originates
    from Open as we already are in Open\'s context.

    The [implementation](../examples/EumlInternalDistributed.cpp) also
    shows the added bonus offered for submachines, which can have both
    the standard transition_table and an internal_transition_table
    (which has higher priority). This makes it easier if you decide to
    make a full submachine from a state. It is also slightly faster than
    the standard alternative, adding orthogonal regions, because event
    dispatching will, if accepted by the internal table, not continue to
    the subregions. This gives you an O(1) dispatch instead of O(number
    of regions).

<a id="kleene-event"></a>
### Kleene (any) event

As for the functor front-end, eUML supports the concept of an *`any`*
event, but boost::any is not an acceptable eUML terminal. If you need an
*any* event, use msm::front::euml::kleene, which inherits boost::any.
The same transition as with boost:any would be:

    State1 + kleene == State2

### Other state types

We saw the `build_state` function, which creates a simple state.
Likewise, eUML provides other state-building macros for other types of
states:

-   BOOST_MSM_EUML_TERMINATE_STATE takes the same arguments as
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE and defines, well, a terminate state.

-   BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERRUPT_STATE takes the same arguments as
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE and defines an interrupt state. However, the
    expression argument must contain as first element the event ending
    the interruption, for example:
    `BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERRUPT_STATE(( end_error /*end interrupt event*/,ErrorMode_Entry,ErrorMode_Exit ),ErrorMode)`

-   BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE takes the same arguments as
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE and defines an exit pseudo state. However, the
    expression argument must contain as first element the event
    propagated from the exit point:
    `BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE(( event6 /*propagated event*/,PseudoExit1_Entry,PseudoExit1_Exit ),PseudoExit1)`

-   BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE defines an entry pseudo state.
    It takes 3 parameters: the region index to be entered is defined as
    an int argument, followed by the configuration expression like
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE and the state name, so that
    `BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE(0 /*region index*/,( SubState2_Entry,SubState2_Exit ),SubState2)`
    defines an entry state into the first region of a submachine.

-   BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE defines an entry pseudo state. It takes 3
    parameters: the region index to be entered is defined as an int
    argument, followed by the configuration expression like
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE and the state name, so that
    `BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE(0,( PseudoEntry1_Entry,PseudoEntry1_Exit ),PseudoEntry1)`
    defines a pseudo entry state into the first region of a submachine.

To use these states in the transition table, eUML offers the functions
`explicit_`, `exit_pt_` and `entry_pt_`. For example, a direct entry
into the substate SubState2 from SubFsm2 could be:

    explicit_(SubFsm2,SubState2) == State1 + event2

Forks being a list on direct entries, eUML supports a logical syntax
(state1, state2, \...), for example:

    (explicit_(SubFsm2,SubState2), 
     explicit_(SubFsm2,SubState2b),
     explicit_(SubFsm2,SubState2c)) == State1 + event3 

An entry point is entered using the same syntax as explicit entries:

    entry_pt_(SubFsm2,PseudoEntry1) == State1 + event4

For exit points, it is again the same syntax except that exit points are
used as source of the transition:

    State2 == exit_pt_(SubFsm2,PseudoExit1) + event6 

The [entry tutorial](../examples/DirectEntryEuml.cpp) is also available
with eUML.

### Helper functions

We saw a few helpers but there are more, so let us have a more complete
description:

-   event\_: used inside any action, the event triggering the transition

-   state\_: used inside entry and exit actions, the entered / exited
    state

-   source\_: used inside a transition action, the source state

-   target\_: used inside a transition action, the target state

-   fsm\_: used inside any action, the (deepest-level) state machine
    processing the transition

-   These objects can also be used as a function and return an
    attribute, for example event\_(cd_name)

-   Int\_\<int value\>: a functor representing an int

-   Char\_\<value\>: a functor representing a char

-   Size_t\_\<value\>: a functor representing a size_t

-   True\_ and False\_ functors returning true and false respectively

-   String\_\<mpl::string\> (boost \>= 1.40): a functor representing a
    string.

-   if_then_else\_(guard, action, action) where action can be an action
    sequence

-   if_then\_(guard, action) where action can be an action sequence

-   while\_(guard, action) where action can be an action sequence

-   do_while\_(guard, action) where action can be an action sequence

-   for\_(action, guard, action, action) where action can be an action
    sequence

-   process\_(some_event \[, some state machine\] \[, some state
    machine\] \[, some state machine\] \[, some state machine\]) will
    call process_event (some_event) on the current state machine or on
    the one(s) passed as 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th argument. This allows
    sending events to several external machines

-   process\_(event\_): reprocesses the event which triggered the
    transition

-   reprocess\_(): same as above but shorter to write

-   process2\_(some_event,Value \[, some state machine\] \[, some state
    machine\] \[, some state machine\]) will call process_event
    (some_event(Value)) on the current state machine or on the one(s)
    passed as 3rd, 4th, 5th argument

-   is\_ flag\_(some_flag\[, some state machine\]) will call
    is_flag_active on the current state machine or on the one passed as
    2nd argument

-   Predicate\_\<some predicate\>: Used in STL algorithms. Wraps
    unary/binary functions to make them eUML-compatible so that they can
    be used in STL algorithms

This can be quite fun. For example,

    /( if_then_else_(--fsm_(m_SongIndex) > Int_<0>(),/*if clause*/
                     show_playing_song, /*then clause*/
                     (fsm_(m_SongIndex)=Int_<1>(),process_(EndPlay))/*else clause*/
                     ) 
      )

means: if (fsm.SongIndex \> 0), call show_playing_song, else
{fsm.SongIndex=1; process EndPlay on fsm;}

A few examples are using these features:

-   the iPod example introduced at the BoostCon09 [has been
    rewritten](../examples/iPodEuml.cpp) with eUML (weak compilers please
    move on\...)

-   the iPodSearch example also introduced at the BoostCon09 [has been
    rewritten](../examples/iPodSearchEuml.cpp) with eUML. In this example,
    you will also find some examples of STL functor usage.

-   [A simpler timer](../examples/SimpleTimer.cpp) example is a good
    starting point.

There is unfortunately a small catch. Defining a functor using
MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION will create a correct functor. Your
own eUML functors written as described at the beginning of this section
will also work well, *except*, for the moment, with the while\_,
if_then\_, if_then_else\_ functions.

### Phoenix-like STL support

eUML supports most C++ operators (except address-of). For example it is
possible to write event\_(some_attribute)++ or \[source\_(some_bool) &&
fsm\_(some_other_bool)\]. But a programmer needs more than operators in
his daily programming. The STL is clearly a must have. Therefore, eUML
comes in with a lot of functors to further reduce the need for your own
functors for the transition table. For almost every algorithm or
container method of the STL, a corresponding eUML function is defined.
Like Boost.Phoenix, "." And "-\>" of call on objects are replaced by a
functional programming paradigm, for example:

-   begin\_(container), end\_(container): return iterators of a
    container

-   empty\_(container): returns container.empty()

-   clear\_(container): container.clear()

-   transform\_: std::transform

In a nutshell, almost every STL method or algorithm is matched by a
corresponding functor, which can then be used in the transition table or
state actions. The [reference](#Reference-begin) lists all eUML
functions and the underlying functor (so that this possibility is not
reserved to eUML but also to the functor-based front-end). The file
structure of this Phoenix-like library matches the one of Boost.Phoenix.
All functors for STL algorithms are to be found in:

    #include <msm/front/euml/algorithm.hpp>

The algorithms are also divided into sub-headers, matching the phoenix
structure for simplicity:

    #include < msm/front/euml/iteration.hpp> 
    #include < msm/front/euml/transformation.hpp>
    #include < msm/front/euml/querying.hpp> 

Container methods can be found in:

    #include < msm/front/euml/container.hpp>

Or one can simply include the whole STL support (you will also need to
include euml.hpp):

    #include < msm/front/euml/stl.hpp>

A few examples (to be found in [this
tutorial](../examples/iPodSearchEuml.cpp)):

-   `push_back_(fsm_(m_tgt_container),event_(m_song))`: the state
    machine has an attribute m_tgt_container of type
    std::vector\<OneSong\> and the event has an attribute m_song of type
    OneSong. The line therefore pushes m_song at the end of
    m_tgt_container

-   `if_then_( state_(m_src_it) != end_(fsm_(m_src_container)), process2_(OneSong(),*(state_(m_src_it)++)) )`:
    the current state has an attribute m_src_it (an iterator). If this
    iterator != fsm.m_src_container.end(), process OneSong on fsm,
    copy-constructed from state.m_src_it which we post-increment

<a id="eUML-phoenix"></a>
### Writing actions with Boost.Phoenix (in development)

It is also possible to write actions, guards, state entry and exit
actions using a reduced set of Boost.Phoenix capabilities. This feature
is still in development stage, so you might get here and there some
surprise. Simple cases, however, should work well. What will not work
will be mixing of eUML and Phoenix functors. Writing guards in one
language and actions in another is ok though.

Phoenix also supports a larger syntax than what will ever be possible
with eUML, so you can only use a reduced set of phoenix\'s grammar. This
is due to the nature of eUML. The run-time transition table definition
is translated to a type using Boost.Typeof. The result is a \"normal\"
MSM transition table made of functor types. As C++ does not allow mixing
run-time and compile-time constructs, there will be some limit (trying
to instantiate a template class MyTemplateClass\<i\> where i is an int
will give you an idea). This means following valid Phoenix constructs
will not work:

-   literals

-   function pointers

-   bind

-   -\>\*

MSM also provides placeholders which make more sense in its context than
arg1 .. argn:

-   \_event: the event triggering the transition

-   \_fsm: the state machine processing the event

-   \_source: the source state of the transition

-   \_target: the target state of the transition

-   \_state: for state entry/exit actions, the entry/exit state

Future versions of MSM will support Phoenix better. You can contribute
by finding out cases which do not work but should, so that they can be
added.

Phoenix support is not activated by default. To activate it, add before
any MSM header: #define BOOST_MSM_EUML_PHOENIX_SUPPORT.

A [simple example](../examples/SimplePhoenix.cpp) shows some basic
capabilities.

## Back-end

There is, at the moment, one back-end. This back-end contains the
library engine and defines the performance and functionality trade-offs.
The currently available back-end implements most of the functionality
defined by the UML 2.0 standard at very high runtime speed, in exchange
for longer compile-time. The runtime speed is due to a constant-time
double-dispatch and self-adapting capabilities allowing the framework to
adapt itself to the features used by a given concrete state machine. All
unneeded features either disable themselves or can be manually disabled.
See section 5.1 for a complete description of the run-to-completion
algorithm.

### Creation

MSM being divided between front and back-end, one needs to first define
a front-end. Then, to create a real state machine, the back-end must be
declared:

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<my_front_end> my_fsm;

We now have a fully functional state machine type. The next sections
will describe what can be done with it.

<a id="backend-start"></a>
### Starting and stopping a state machine

The `start()` method starts the state machine, meaning it will activate
the initial state, which means in turn that the initial state\'s entry
behavior will be called. We need the start method because you do not
always want the entry behavior of the initial state to be called
immediately but only when your state machine is ready to process events.
A good example of this is when you use a state machine to write an
algorithm and each loop back to the initial state is an algorithm call.
Each call to start will make the algorithm run once. The
[iPodSearch](../examples/iPodSearch.cpp) example uses this possibility.

The `stop()` method works the same way. It will cause the exit actions
of the currently active state(s) to be called.

Both methods are actually not an absolute need. Not calling them will
simply cause your first entry or your last exit action not to be called.

### Event dispatching

The main reason to exist for a state machine is to dispatch events. For
MSM, events are objects of a given event type. The object itself can
contain data, but the event type is what decides of the transition to be
taken. For MSM, if some_event is a given type (a simple struct for
example) and e1 and e2 concrete instances of some_event, e1 and e2 are
equivalent, from a transition perspective. Of course, e1 and e2 can have
different values and you can use them inside actions. Events are
dispatched as const reference, so actions cannot modify events for
obvious side-effect reasons. To dispatch an event of type some_event,
you can simply create one on the fly or instantiate if before
processing:

    my_fsm fsm; fsm.process_event(some_event());
    some_event e1; fsm.process_event(e1)

Creating an event on the fly will be optimized by the compiler so the
performance will not degrade.

### Active state(s)

The backend also offers a way to know which state is active, though you
will normally only need this for debugging purposes. If what you need
simply is doing something with the active state, `internal transitions`
or `visitors` are a better alternative. If you need to know what state
is active, const int\* current_state() will return an array of state
ids. Please refer to the `internals section` to know how state ids are
generated.

### Upper State Machine

The FSM template argument passed to functors or entry/exit actions is
the current state machine, which might not be what is wanted as the
upper state machine makes more sense. The back-end provides a
get_upper() function returning a pointer to the upper state machine,
which is usually what you want to call process_event on.

<a id="back-end-serialization"></a>
### Serialization

A common need is the ability to save a state machine and restore it at a
different time. MSM supports this feature for the basic and functor
front-ends, and in a more limited manner for eUML. MSM supports
boost::serialization out of the box (by offering a `serialize`
function). Actually, for basic serialization, you need not do much, a
MSM state machine is serializable almost like any other type. Without
any special work, you can make a state machine remember its state, for
example:

    MyFsm fsm;
    // write to archive
    std::ofstream ofs("fsm.txt");
    // save fsm to archive
    {
        boost::archive::text_oarchive oa(ofs);
        // write class instance to archive
        oa << fsm;
    }                                                  

Loading back is very similar:

    MyFsm fsm;
    {
        // create and open an archive for input
        std::ifstream ifs("fsm.txt");
        boost::archive::text_iarchive ia(ifs);
        // read class state from archive
        ia >> fsm;
    }                                          

This will (de)serialize the state machine itself but not the concrete
states\' data. This can be done on a per-state basis to reduce the
amount of typing necessary. To allow serialization of a concrete state,
provide a do_serialize typedef and implement the serialize function:

    struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> 
    {
        // we want Empty to be serialized. First provide the typedef
        typedef int do_serialize;
        // then implement serialize
        template<class Archive>
        void serialize(Archive & ar, const unsigned int /* version */)
        {
            ar & some_dummy_data;
        }
        Empty():some_dummy_data(0){}           
        int some_dummy_data;
    };                        

You can also serialize data contained in the front-end class. Again, you
need to provide the typedef and implement serialize:

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>
    {
        //we might want to serialize some data contained by the front-end
        int front_end_data;
        player_():front_end_data(0){}
        // to achieve this, provide the typedef
        typedef int do_serialize;
        // and implement serialize
        template<class Archive>
        void serialize(Archive & ar, const unsigned int )
        {
            ar & front_end_data;
        }  
    ...
    };                                               

The saving of the back-end data (the current state(s)) is valid for all
front-ends, so a front-end written using eUML can be serialized.
However, to serialize a concrete state, the macros like
`BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE` cannot be used, so the state will have to be
implemented by directly inheriting from `front::euml::euml_state`.

The only limitation is that the event queues cannot be serialized so
serializing must be done in a stable state, when no event is being
processed. You can serialize during event processing only if using no
queue (deferred or event queue).

This [example](../examples/Serialize.cpp) shows a state machine which we
serialize after processing an event. The `Empty` state also has some
data to serialize.

<a id="backend-base-state"></a>
### Base state type

Sometimes, one needs to customize states to avoid repetition and provide
a common functionality, for example in the form of a virtual method. You
might also want to make your states polymorphic so that you can call
typeid on them for logging or debugging. It is also useful if you need a
visitor, like the next section will show. You will notice that all
front-ends offer the possibility of adding a base type. Note that all
states and state machines must have the same base state, so this could
reduce reuse. For example, using the basic front end, you need to:

-   Add the non-default base state in your msm::front::state\<\>
    definition, as first template argument (except for interrupt_states
    for which it is the second argument, the first one being the event
    ending the interrupt), for example, my_base_state being your new
    base state for all states in a given state machine:

        struct Empty : public msm::front::state<my_base_state>

    Now, my_base_state is your new base state. If it has a virtual
    function, your states become polymorphic. MSM also provides a
    default polymorphic base type, `msm::front::polymorphic_state`

-   Add the user-defined base state in the state machine frontend
    definition, as a second template argument, for example:

        struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine<player_,my_base_state>             

You can also ask for a state with a given id (which you might have
gotten from current_state()) using
`const base_state* get_state_by_id(int id) const` where base_state is
the one you just defined. You can now do something polymorphically.

<a id="backend-visitor"></a>
### Visitor

In some cases, having a pointer-to-base of the currently active states
is not enough. You might want to call non-virtually a method of the
currently active states. It will not be said that MSM forces the virtual
keyword down your throat!

To achieve this goal, MSM provides its own variation of a visitor
pattern using the previously described user-defined state technique. If
you add to your user-defined base state an `accept_sig` typedef giving
the return value (unused for the moment) and parameters and provide an
accept method with this signature, calling visit_current_states will
cause accept to be called on the currently active states. Typically, you
will also want to provide an empty default accept in your base state in
order not to force all your states to implement accept. For example your
base state could be:

    struct my_visitable_state
    {
       // signature of the accept function
       typedef args<void> accept_sig;
       // we also want polymorphic states
       virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
       // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
       void accept() const {}
    };

This makes your states polymorphic and visitable. In this case, accept
is made const and takes no argument. It could also be:

    struct SomeVisitor {â€¦};
    struct my_visitable_state
    {
        // signature of the accept function
        typedef args<void,SomeVisitor&> accept_sig;
        // we also want polymorphic states
        virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
        // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
        void accept(SomeVisitor&) const {}
    };

And now, `accept` will take one argument (it could also be non-const).
By default, `accept` takes up to 2 arguments. To get more, set #define
BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE to another value before including
state_machine.hpp. For example:

    #define BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE 3
    #include <boost/msm/back/state_machine.hpp>

Note that accept will be called on ALL active states *and also
automatically on sub-states of a submachine*.

*Important warning*: The method visit_current_states takes its parameter
by value, so if the signature of the accept function is to contain a
parameter passed by reference, pass this parameter with a boost:ref/cref
to avoid undesired copies or slicing. So, for example, in the above
case, call:

    SomeVisitor vis; sm.visit_current_states(boost::ref(vis));

This [example](../examples/SM-2Arg.cpp) uses a visiting function with 2
arguments.

### Flags

Flags is a MSM-only concept, supported by all front-ends, which base
themselves on the functions:

    template <class Flag> bool is_flag_active()
    template <class Flag,class BinaryOp> bool is_flag_active()

These functions return true if the currently active state(s) support the
Flag property. The first variant ORs the result if there are several
orthogonal regions, the second one expects OR or AND, for example:

    my_fsm.is_flag_active<MyFlag>()
    my_fsm.is_flag_active<MyFlag,my_fsm_type::Flag_OR>()

Please refer to the front-ends sections for usage examples.

### Getting a state

It is sometimes necessary to have the client code get access to the
states\' data. After all, the states are created once for good and hang
around as long as the state machine does, so why not use it? You simply
just need sometimes to get information about any state, even inactive
ones. An example is if you want to write a coverage tool and know how
many times a state was visited. To get a state, use the get_state method
giving the state name, for example:

    player::Stopped* tempstate = p.get_state<player::Stopped*>();

or

    player::Stopped& tempstate2 = p.get_state<player::Stopped&>();

depending on your personal taste.

<a id="backend-fsm-constructor-args"></a>
### State machine constructor with arguments

You might want to define a state machine with a non-default constructor.
For example, you might want to write:

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_> 
    { 
        player_(int some_value){â€¦} 
    }; 

This is possible, using the back-end as forwarding object:

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<player_ > player; player p(3);

The back-end will call the corresponding front-end constructor upon
creation.

You can pass arguments up to the value of the
BOOST_MSM_CONSTRUCTOR_ARG_SIZE macro (currently 5) arguments. Change
this value before including any header if you need to overwrite the
default.

You can also pass arguments by reference (or const-reference) using
boost::ref (or boost::cref):

    struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def<player_>  
    {
       player_(SomeType& t, int some_value){â€¦}  
    }; 

    typedef msm::back11::state_machine<player_ > player; 
    SomeType data;
    player p(boost::ref(data),3);
                        

Normally, MSM default-constructs all its states or submachines. There
are however cases where you might not want this. An example is when you
use a state machine as submachine, and this submachine used the above
defined constructors. You can add as first argument of the state machine
constructor an expression where existing states are passed and copied:

    player p( back::states_ << state_1 << ... << state_n , boost::ref(data),3);

Where state_1..n are instances of some or all of the states of the state
machine. Submachines being state machines, this can recurse, for
example, if Playing is a submachine containing a state Song1 having
itself a constructor where some data is passed:

    player p( back::states_ << Playing(back::states_ << Song1(some_Song1_data)) , 
              boost::ref(data),3);

It is also possible to replace a given state by a new instance at any
time using `set_states()` and the same syntax, for example:

    p.set_states( back::states_ << state_1 << ... << state_n );

An [example](../examples/Constructor.cpp) making intensive use of this
capability is provided.

<a id="backend-tradeof-rt-ct"></a>
### Trading run-time speed for better compile-time / multi-TU compilation

MSM is optimized for run-time speed at the cost of longer compile-time.
This can become a problem with older compilers and big state machines,
especially if you don\'t really care about run-time speed that much and
would be satisfied by a performance roughly the same as most state
machine libraries. MSM offers a back-end policy to help there. But
before you try it, if you are using a VC compiler, deactivate the /Gm
compiler option (default for debug builds). This option can cause builds
to be 3 times longer\... If the compile-time still is a problem, read
further. MSM offers a policy which will speed up compiling in two main
cases:

-   many transition conflicts

-   submachines

The back-end `msm::back11::state_machine` has a policy argument (first
is the front-end, then the history policy) defaulting to
`favor_runtime_speed`. To switch to `favor_compile_time`, which is
declared in `<msm/back/favor_compile_time.hpp>`, you need to:

-   switch the policy to `favor_compile_time` for the main state machine
    (and possibly submachines)

-   move the submachine declarations into their own header which
    includes `<msm/back/favor_compile_time.hpp>`

-   add for each submachine a cpp file including your header and calling
    a macro, which generates helper code, for example:

        #include "mysubmachine.hpp"
        BOOST_MSM_BACK_GENERATE_PROCESS_EVENT(mysubmachine)

-   configure your compiler for multi-core compilation

You will now compile your state machine on as many cores as you have
submachines, which will greatly speed up the compilation if you factor
your state machine into smaller submachines.

Independently, transition conflicts resolution will also be much faster.

This policy uses boost.any behind the hood, which means that we will
lose a feature which MSM offers with the default policy, [event
hierarchy](#event-hierarchy). The following example takes our iPod
example and speeds up compile-time by using this technique. We have:

-   [our main state machine and main
    function](../examples/iPod_distributed/iPod.cpp)

-   [PlayingMode moved to a separate
    header](../examples/iPod_distributed/PlayingMode.hpp)

-   [a cpp for PlayingMode](../examples/iPod_distributed/PlayingMode.cpp)

-   [MenuMode moved to a separate
    header](../examples/iPod_distributed/MenuMode.hpp)

-   [a cpp for MenuMode](../examples/iPod_distributed/MenuMode.cpp)

-   [events move to a separate header as all machines use
    it](../examples/iPod_distributed/Events.hpp)

<a id="backend-compile-time-analysis"></a>
### Compile-time state machine analysis

A MSM state machine being a metaprogram, it is only logical that
checking for the validity of a concrete state machine happens
compile-time. To this aim, using the compile-time graph library
[mpl_graph](http://www.dynagraph.org/mpl_graph/) (delivered at the
moment with MSM) from Gordon Woodhull, MSM provides several compile-time
checks:

-   Check that orthogonal regions are truly orthogonal.

-   Check that all states are either reachable from the initial states
    or are explicit entries / pseudo-entry states.

To make use of this feature, the back-end provides a policy (default is
no analysis), `msm::back::mpl_graph_fsm_check`. For example:

     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::mpl_graph_fsm_check> player;           

As MSM is now using Boost.Parameter to declare policies, the policy
choice can be made at any position after the front-end type (in this
case `player_`).

In case an error is detected, a compile-time assertion is provoked.

This feature is not enabled by default because it has a non-neglectable
compile-time cost. The algorithm is linear if no explicit or pseudo
entry states are found in the state machine, unfortunately still
O(number of states \* number of entry states) otherwise. This will be
improved in future versions of MSM.

The same algorithm is also used in case you want to omit providing the
region index in the `explicit entry / pseudo entry state` declaration.

The author\'s advice is to enable the checks after any state machine
structure change and disable it again after sucessful analysis.

The [following example](../examples/TestErrorOrthogonality.cpp) provokes an
assertion if one of the first two lines of the transition table is used.

<a id="backend-enqueueing"></a>
### Enqueueing events for later processing

Calling `process_event(Event const&)` will immediately process the event
with run-to-completion semantics. You can also enqueue the events and
delay their processing by calling `enqueue_event(Event const&)` instead.
Calling `execute_queued_events()` will then process all enqueued events
(in FIFO order). Calling `execute_single_queued_event()` will execute
the oldest enqueued event.

You can query the queue size by calling `get_message_queue_size()`.

<a id="backend-queues"></a>
### Customizing the message queues

MSM uses by default a std::deque for its queues (one message queue for
events generated during run-to-completion or with `enqueue_event`, one
for deferred events). Unfortunately, on some STL implementations, it is
a very expensive container in size and copying time. Should this be a
problem, MSM offers an alternative based on boost::circular_buffer. The
policy is msm::back::queue_container_circular. To use it, you need to
provide it to the back-end definition:

     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::queue_container_circular> player;           

You can access the queues with get_message_queue and get_deferred_queue,
both returning a reference or a const reference to the queues
themselves. Boost::circular_buffer is outside of the scope of this
documentation. What you will however need to define is the queue
capacity (initially is 0) to what you think your queue will at most
grow, for example (size 1 is common):

     fsm.get_message_queue().set_capacity(1);           

<a id="backend-boost-parameter"></a>
### Policy definition with Boost.Parameter

MSM uses Boost.Parameter to allow easier definition of
back11::state_machine\<\> policy arguments (all except the front-end).
This allows you to define policy arguments (history, compile-time /
run-time, state machine analysis, container for the queues) at any
position, in any number. For example:

     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::mpl_graph_fsm_check> player;  
     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::AlwaysHistory> player;  
     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::mpl_graph_fsm_check,msm::back::AlwaysHistory> player; 
     typedef msm::back11::state_machine< player_,msm::back::AlwaysHistory,msm::back::mpl_graph_fsm_check> player;

### Choosing when to switch active states

The UML Standard is silent about a very important question: when a
transition fires, at which exact point is the target state the new
active state of a state machine? At the end of the transition? After the
source state has been left? What if an exception is thrown? The Standard
considers that run-to-completion means a transition completes in almost
no time. But even this can be in some conditions a very very long time.
Consider the following example. We have a state machine representing a
network connection. We can be `Connected` and `Disconnected`. When we
move from one state to another, we send a (Boost) Signal to another
entity. By default, MSM makes the target state as the new state after
the transition is completed. We want to send a signal based on a flag
is_connected which is true when in state Connected.

We are in state `Disconnected` and receive an event `connect`. The
transition action will ask the state machine
`is_flag_active<is_connected>` and will get\... false because we are
still in `Disconnected`. Hmm, what to do? We could queue the action and
execute it later, but it means an extra queue, more work and higher
run-time.

MSM provides the possibility (in form of a policy) for a front-end to
decide when the target state becomes active. It can be:

-   before the transition fires, if the guard will allow the transition
    to fire: `active_state_switch_before_transition`

-   after calling the exit action of the source state:
    `active_state_switch_after_exit`

-   after the transition action is executed:
    `active_state_switch_after_transition_action`

-   after the entry action of the target state is executed (default):
    `active_state_switch_after_entry`

The problem and the solution is shown for the
[functor-front-end](../examples/ActiveStateSetBeforeTransition.cpp) and
[eUML](../examples/ActivateStateBeforeTransitionEuml.cpp). Removing
`active_state_switch_before_transition` will show the default state.

# Performance / Compilers

*[â†‘ Back to top](#table-of-contents)*


Tests were made on different PCs running Windows XP and Vista and
compiled with VC9 SP1 or Ubuntu and compiled with g++ 4.2 and 4.3. For
these tests, the same player state machine was written using
Boost.Statechart, as a [state machine with only simple
states](../examples/SCSimple.cpp) and as a [state machine with a composite
state](../examples/SCComposite.cpp). The same simple and composite state
machines are implemented with MSM with a standard frontend
[(simple)](../examples/MsmSimple.cpp)[(composite)](../examples/MsmComposite.cpp),
the simple one also with [functors](../examples/MsmSimpleFunctors.cpp) and
with [eUML](../examples/EumlSimple.cpp). As these simple machines need no
terminate/interrupt states, no message queue and have no-throw guarantee
on their actions, the MSM state machines are defined with minimum
functionality. Test machine is a Q6600 2.4GHz, Vista 64.

## Speed

VC9:

-   The simple test completes 90 times faster with MSM than with
    Boost.Statechart

-   The composite test completes 25 times faster with MSM

gcc 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 8.04 in VMWare, same PC):

-   The simple test completes 46 times faster with MSM

-   The composite test completes 19 times faster with MSM

## Executable size

There are some worries that MSM generates huge code. Is it true? The 2
compilers I tested disagree with this claim. On VC9, the test state
machines used in the performance section produce executables of 14kB
(for simple and eUML) and 21kB (for the composite). This includes the
test code and iostreams. By comparison, an empty executable with
iostreams generated by VC9 has a size of 7kB. Boost.Statechart generates
executables of 43kB and 54kB. As a bonus, eUML comes for "free" in terms
of executable size. You even get a speed gain. With g++ 4.3, it strongly
depends on the compiler options (much more than VC). A good size state
machine with --O3 can generate an executable of 600kB, and with eUML you
can get to 1.5MB. Trying with --Os --s I come down to 18kB and 30kB for
the test state machines, while eUML will go down to 1MB (which is still
big), so in this case eUML does not come for free.

## Supported compilers

For a current status, have a look at the [regression
tests](http://www.boost.org/development/tests/trunk/developer/msm.html).

MSM was successfully tested with:

-   VC8 (partly), VC9, VC10

-   g++ 4.0.1 and higher

-   Intel 10.1 and higher

-   Clang 2.9

-   Green Hills Software MULTI for ARM v5.0.5 patch 4416 (Simple and
    Composite tutorials)

-   Partial support for IBM compiler

VC8 and to some lesser extent VC9 suffer from a bug. Enabling the option
\"Enable Minimal Rebuild\" (/Gm) will cause much higher compile-time (up
to three times with VC8!). This option being activated per default in
Debug mode, this can be a big problem.

## Limitations

-   Compilation times of state machines with \> 80 transitions that are
    going to make you storm the CFO\'s office and make sure you get a
    shiny octocore with 12GB RAM by next week, unless he\'s interested
    in paying you watch the compiler agonize for hours\... (Make sure
    you ask for dual 24\" as well, it doesn\'t hurt.)

-   eUML allows very long constructs but will also quickly increase your
    compile time on some compilers (VC9, VC10) with buggy decltype
    support (I suspect some at least quadratic algorithms there). Even
    g++ 4.4 shows some regression compared to 4.3 and will crash if the
    constructs become too big.

-   Need to overwrite the mpl::vector/list default-size-limit of 20 and
    fusion default vector size of 10 if more than 10 states found in a
    state machine

-   `Limitation for submachines` and entry actions requiring an event
    property.

## Compilers corner

Compilers are sometimes full of surprises and such strange errors
happened in the course of the development that I wanted to list the most
fun for readers' entertainment.

*VC8*:

    template <class StateType>
    typename ::boost::enable_if<
           typename ::boost::mpl::and_<
                    typename ::boost::mpl::not_<
                        typename has_exit_pseudo_states<StateType>::type
                    >::type,
                    typename ::boost::mpl::not_<
                        typename is_pseudo_exit<StateType>::type
                    >::type 
           >::type,
           BaseState*>::type                   

I get the following error:

error C2770: invalid explicit template argument(s) for \'\`global
namespace\'::boost::enable_if\<\...\>::\...\'

If I now remove the first "::" in ::boost::mpl, the compiler shuts up.
So in this case, it is not possible to follow Boost's guidelines.

*VC9*:

-   This one is my all times' favorite. Do you know why the exit pseudo
    states are referenced in the transition table with a
    "submachine::exit_pt"? Because "exit" will crash the compiler.
    "Exit" is not possible either because it will crash the compiler on
    one machine, but not on another (the compiler was installed from the
    same disk).

-   Sometimes, removing a policy crashes the compiler, so some versions
    are defining a dummy policy called WorkaroundVC9.

-   Typeof: While g++ and VC9 compile "standard" state machines in
    comparable times, Typeof (while in both ways natively supported)
    seems to behave in a quadratic complexity with VC9 and VC10.

-   eUML: in case of a compiler crash, changing the order of state
    definitions (first states without entry or exit) sometimes solves
    the problem.

*g++ 4.x*: Boring compiler, almost all is working almost as expected.
Being not a language lawyer I am unsure about the following "Typeof
problem". VC9 and g++ disagree on the question if you can derive from
the BOOST_TYPEOF generated type without first defining a typedef. I will
be thankful for an answer on this. I only found two ways to break the
compiler:

-   Add more eUML constructs until something explodes (especially with
    g++-4.4)

-   The build_terminate function uses 2 mpl::push_back instead of
    mpl::insert_range because g++ would not accept insert_range.

You can test your compiler's decltype implementation with the [following
stress test](../examples/CompilerStressTestEuml.cpp) and reactivate the
commented-out code until the compiler crashes.

# Questions & Answers, tips

*[â†‘ Back to top](#table-of-contents)*


*Where should I define a state machine?*: The tutorials are implemented
in a simple cpp source file for simplicity. I want to model dynamic
behavior of a class as a state machine, how should I define the state
machine?

*Answer*: Usually you\'ll want to implement the state machine as an
attribute of the class. Unfortunately, a concrete state machine is a
typedef, which cannot be forward-declared. This leaves you with two
possibilities:

-   Provide the state machine definition inside the header class and
    contain an instance as attribute. Simple, but with several
    drawbacks: using namespace directives are not advised, and
    compile-time cost for all modules including the header.

-   Keep the state machine as (shared) pointer to void inside the [class
    definition](../examples/FsmAsPtr.hpp), and implement the state machine
    in the [cpp file](../examples/FsmAsPtr.cpp). Minimum compile-time,
    using directives are okay, but the state machine is now located
    inside the heap.

*Question*: on_entry gets as argument the sent event. What event do I
get when the state becomes default-activated (because it is an initial
state)?

*Answer*: To allow you to know that the state was default-activated, MSM
generates a boost::msm::InitEvent default event.

*Question*: Why do I see no call to no_transition in my submachine?

*Answer*: Because of the priority rule defined by UML. It says that in
case of transition conflict, the most inner state has a higher priority.
So after asking the inner state, the containing composite has to be also
asked to handle the transition and could find a possible transition.

*Question*: Why do I get a compile error saying the compiler cannot
convert to a function \...Fsm::\*(some_event)?

*Answer*: You probably defined a transition triggered by the event
some_event, but used a guard/action method taking another event.

*Question*: Why do I get a compile error saying something like "too few"
or "too many" template arguments?

*Answer*: You probably defined a transition in form of an a_row or g_row
where you wanted just a \_row or the other way around. With Row, it
could mean that you forgot a \"none\".

*Question*: Why do I get a very long compile error when I define more
than 20 rows in the transition table?

*Answer*: MSM uses Boost.MPL under the hood and this is the default
maximum size. Please define the following 3 macros before including any
MSM headers:

    #define BOOST_MPL_CFG_NO_PREPROCESSED_HEADERS
    #define BOOST_MPL_LIMIT_VECTOR_SIZE 30 // or whatever you need               
    #define BOOST_MPL_LIMIT_MAP_SIZE 30 // or whatever you need 

*Question*: Why do I get this error: "error C2977:
\'boost::mpl::vector\' : too many template arguments"?

*Answer*: The first possibility is that you defined a transition table
as, say, vector17 and have 18 entries. The second is that you have 17
entries and have a composite state. Under the hood, MSM adds a row for
every event in the composite transition table. The third one is that you
used a mpl::vector without the number of entries but are close to the
MPL default of 50 and have a composite, thus pushing you above 50. Then
you need mpl/vector60/70....hpp and a mpl/map60/70....hpp.

*Question*: Why do I get a very long compile error when I define more
than 10 states in a state machine?

*Answer*: MSM uses Boost.Fusion under the hood and this is the default
maximum size. Please define the following macro before including any MSM
headers:

    #define FUSION_MAX_VECTOR_SIZE 20 // or whatever you need 

# Internals

This chapter describes the internal machinery of the back-end, which can
be useful for UML experts but can be safely ignored for most users. For
implementers, the interface between front- and back-end is also
described in detail.

<a id="run-to-completion"></a>
## Backend: Run To Completion

The back-end implements the following run-to-completion algorithm:

-   Check if one region of the concrete state machine is in a terminate
    or interrupt state. If yes, event processing is disabled while the
    condition lasts (forever for a terminate pseudo-state, while active
    for an interrupt pseudo-state).

-   If the message queue feature is enabled and if the state machine is
    already processing an event, push the currently processed event into
    the queue and end processing. Otherwise, remember that the state
    machine is now processing an event and continue.

-   If the state machine detected that no deferred event is used, skip
    this step. Otherwise, mark the first deferred event from the
    deferred queue as active.

-   Now start the core of event dispatching. If exception handling is
    activated, this will happen inside a try/catch block and the
    front-end `exception_caught` is called if an exception occurs.

-   The event is now dispatched in turn to every region, in the order
    defined by the initial state front-end definition. This will, for
    every region, call the corresponding front-end transition definition
    (the \"row\" or \"Row\" of the transition table).

-   Without transition conflict, if for a given region a transition is
    possible, the guard condition is checked. If it returns `true`, the
    transition processing continues and the current state\'s exit action
    is called, followed by the transition action behavior and the new
    active state\'s entry behavior.

-   With transition conflicts (several possible transitions,
    disambiguated by mutually exclusive guard conditions), the guard
    conditions are tried in reverse order of their transition definition
    in the transition table. The first one returning `true` selects its
    transition. Note that this is not defined by the UML standard, which
    simply specifies that if the guard conditions are not mutually
    exclusive, the state machine is ill-formed and the behaviour
    undefined. Relying on this implementation-specific behaviour will
    make it harder for the developer to support another state machine
    framework.

-   If at least one region processes the event, this event is seen as
    having been accepted. If not, the library calls `no_transition` on
    the state machine for every contained region.

-   If the currently active state is a submachine, the behaviour is
    slightly different. The UML standard specifies that internal
    transitions have to be tried first, so the event is first dispatched
    to the submachine. Only if the submachine does not accept the event
    are other (non internal) transitions tried.

-   This back-end supports simple states\' and submachines\' internal
    transitions. These are provided in the state\'s
    `internal_transition_table` type. Transitions defined in this table
    are added at the end of the main state machine\'s transition table,
    but with a lesser priority than the submachine\'s transitions
    (defined in `transition_table`). This means, for simple states, that
    these transitions have higher priority than non-internal
    transitions, conform to the UML standard which gives higher priority
    to deeper-level transitions. For submachines, this is a non-standard
    addition which can help make event processing faster by giving a
    chance to bypass subregion processing. With standard UML, one would
    need to add a subregion only to process these internal transitions,
    which would be slower.

-   After the dispatching itself, the deferred event marked in step 3
    (if any) now gets a chance of processing.

-   Then, events queued in the message queue also get a dispatching
    chance.

-   Finally, completion / anonymous transitions, if to be found in the
    transition table, also get their dispatching chance.

This algorithm illustrates how the back-end configures itself at
compile-time as much as possible. Every feature not found in a given
state machine definition is deactivated and has therefore no runtime
cost. Completion events, deferred events, terminate states, dispatching
to several regions, internal transitions are all deactivated if not
used. User configuration is only for exception handling and message
queue necessary.

<a id="internals-front-back-interface"></a>
## Frontend / Backend interface

The design of MSM tries to make front-ends and back-ends (later) to be
as interchangeable as possible. Of course, no back-end will ever
implement every feature defined by any possible front-end and inversely,
but the goal is to make it as easy as possible to extend the current
state of the library.

To achieve this, MSM divides the functionality between both sides: the
front-end is a sort of user interface and is descriptive, the back-end
implements the state machine engine.

MSM being based on a transition table, a concrete state machine (or a
given front-end) must provide a transition_table. This transition table
must be made of rows. And each row must tell what kind of transition it
is and implement the calls to the actions and guards. A state machine
must also define its regions (marked by initial states). And that is
about the only constraints for front-ends. How the rows are described is
implementer\'s choice.

Every row must provide:

-   A `Source` typedef indicating, well, the type of the source state.

-   A `Target` typedef indicating, well, the type of the target state.

-   An `Evt` typedef indicating the type of the event triggering the
    transition.

-   A `row_type_tag` typedef indicating the type of the transition.

-   Rows having a type requiring transition actions must provide a
    static function `action_call` with the following signature:
    `template <class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState,class AllStates>`

    `static void action_call (Fsm& fsm, Event const& evt, SourceState&, TargetState&, AllStates&)`

    The function gets as parameters the (back-end) state machine, the
    event, source and target states and a container (in the current
    back-end, a fusion::set) of all the states defined in the state
    machine. For example, as the back-end has the front-end as basic
    class, `action_call` is simply defined as `(fsm.*action)(evt)`.

-   Rows having a type requiring a guard must provide a static function
    `guard_call` with the following signature:``

    `template <class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState,class AllStates>`

    `static bool guard_call (Fsm&, Event const&, SourceState&, TargetState&, AllStates&)`

-   The possible transition (row) types are:

    -   a_row_tag: a transition with actions and no guard

    -   g_row_type: a transition with a guard and no actions

    -   \_row_tag: a transition without actions or guard

    -   row_tag: a transition with guard and actions

    -   a_irow_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `transition_table`) with actions

    -   g_irow_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `transition_table`) with guard

    -   irow_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `transition_table`) with actions and guards

    -   \_irow_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `transition_table`) without action or guard. Due to higher
        priority for internal transitions, this is equivalent to a
        \"ignore event\"

    -   sm_a\_i_row_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `internal_transition_table`) with actions

    -   sm_g\_i_row_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `internal_transition_table`) with guard

    -   sm_i\_row_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `internal_transition_table`) with actions and guards

    -   sm\_\_i_row_tag: an internal transition (defined inside the
        `internal_transition_table`) without action or guard. Due to
        higher priority for internal transitions, this is equivalent to
        an \"ignore event\"

Furthermore, a front-end must provide the definition of states and state
machines. State machine definitions must provide (the implementer is
free to provide it or let it be done by every concrete state machine;
different MSM front-ends took one or the other approach):

-   `initial_state`: This typedef can be a single state or a mpl
    container and provides the initial states defining one or several
    orthogonal regions.

-   `transition_table`: This typedef is a MPL sequence of transition
    rows.

-   `configuration`: this typedef is a MPL sequence of known types
    triggering special behavior in the back-end, for example if a
    concrete fsm requires a message queue or exception catching.

States and state machines must both provide a (possibly empty)
definition of:

-   `flag_list`: the flags being active when this state or state machine
    becomes the current state of the fsm.

-   `deferred_events`: events being automatically deferred when the
    state is the current state of the fsm.

-   `internal_transition_table`: the internal transitions of this state.

-   `on_entry` and `on_exit` methods.

<a id="internals-state-id"></a>
## Generated state ids

Normally, one does not need to know the ids are generated for all the
states of a state machine, unless for debugging purposes, like the
pstate function does in the tutorials in order to display the name of
the current state. This section will show how to automatically display
typeid-generated names, but these are not very readable on all
platforms, so it can help to know how the ids are generated. The ids are
generated using the transition table, from the "Start" column up to
down, then from the "Next" column, up to down, as shown in the next
image:

![](../images/AnnexA.jpg)
Stopped will get id 0, Open id 1, ErrorMode id 6 and SleepMode (seen
only in the "Next" column) id 7. If you have some implicitly created
states, like transition-less initial states or states created using the
explicit_creation typedef, these will be added as a source at the end of
the transition table. If you have submachine states, a row will be added
for them at the end of the table, after the automatically or explicitly
created states, which can change their id. The next help you will need
for debugging would be to call the current_state method of the
state_machine class, then the display_type helper to generate a readable
name from the id. If you do not want to go through the transition table
to fill an array of names, the library provides another helper,
fill_state_names, which, given an array of sufficient size (please see
next section to know how many states are defined in the state machine),
will fill it with typeid-generated names.

## Metaprogramming tools

We can find for the transition table more uses than what we have seen so
far. Let\'s suppose you need to write a coverage tool. A state machine
would be perfect for such a job, if only it could provide some
information about its structure. Thanks to the transition table and
Boost.MPL, it does.

What is needed for a coverage tool? You need to know how many states are
defined in the state machine, and how many events can be fired. This way
you can log the fired events and the states visited in the life of a
concrete machine and be able to perform some coverage analysis, like
"fired 65% of all possible events and visited 80% of the states defined
in the state machine". To achieve this, MSM provides a few useful tools:

-   generate_state_set\<transition table\>: returns a mpl::set of all
    the states defined in the table.

-   generate_event_set\<transition table\>: returns a mpl::set of all
    the events defined in the table.

-   using mpl::size\<\>::value you can get the number of elements in the
    set.

-   display_type defines an operator() sending typeid(Type).name() to
    cout.

-   fill_state_names fills an array of char const\* with names of all
    states (found by typeid).

-   using mpl::for_each on the result of generate_state_set and
    generate_event_set passing display_type as argument will display all
    the states of the state machine.

-   let\'s suppose you need to recursively find the states and events
    defined in the composite states and thus also having a transition
    table. Calling recursive_get_transition_table\<Composite\> will
    return you the transition table of the composite state, recursively
    adding the transition tables of all sub-state machines and
    sub-sub\...-sub-state machines. Then call generate_state_set or
    generate_event_set on the result to get the full list of states and
    events.

An [example](../examples/BoostCon09Full.cpp) shows the tools in action.

-   Bugfix: copy breaks exit points of subsubmachines.

-   Bugfix: Trac 8046.

## From V2.23 to V2.24 (Boost 1.51)

-   Support for `boost::any` or `kleene` as an acceptable event.

-   Bugfix: compiler error with fsm internal table and `none`(compound)
    event.

-   Bugfix: `euml::defer_` leading to stack overflow.

## From V2.22 to V2.23 (Boost 1.50)

-   `eUML` : better syntax for front-ends defined with eUML as
    transititon table only. Caution: Breaking Change!

-   Bugfix: graph building was only working if `initial_state` defined
    as a sequence

-   Bugfix: flags defined for a Terminate or Interrupt state do not
    break the blocking function of these states any more.

-   Bugfix: multiple deferred events from several regions were not
    working in every case.

-   Bugfix: visitor was passed by value to submachines.

-   Bugfix: `no_transition` was not called for submachines who send an
    event to themselves.

-   Fixed warnings with gcc

## From V2.21 to V2.22 (Boost 1.48)

-   eUML: added easier event reprocessing: `process(event_)` and
    `reprocess()`

-   Rewrite of internal transition tables. There were a few bugs
    (failing recursivity in internal transition tables of sub-sub
    machines) and a missing feature (unused internal transition table of
    the main state machine).

-   Bugfixes

    -   Reverted favor_compile_time policy to Boost 1.46 state

    -   `none` event now is convertible from any other event

    -   eUML and pseudo exit states

    -   Fixed not working Flag_AND

    -   Fixed rare bugs causing multiple processing of the same event in
        a submachine whose transition table contains this event and a
        base event of it.

    -   gcc warnings about unused variables

-   Breaking change: the new internal transition table feature causes a
    minor breaking change. In a submachine, the \"Fsm\" template
    parameter for guards / actions of an internal table declared using
    `internal_transition_table` now is the submachine, not the
    higher-level state machine. Internal transitions declared using
    internal rows in the higher-level state machine keep their behavior
    (the \"Fsm\" parameter is the higher-level state machine). To sum
    up, the internal transition \"Fsm\" parameter is the closest state
    machine containing this transition.

## From V2.20 to V2.21 (Boost 1.47)

-   Added a `stop()` method in the back-end.

-   `Added partial support for Boost.Phoenix functors in eUML`

-   Added the possibility to choose when `state switching` occurs.

-   Bugfixes

    -   Trac 5117, 5253, 5533, 5573

    -   gcc warnings about unused variables

    -   better implemenation of favor_compile_time back-end policy

    -   bug with eUML and state construction

    -   incorrect eUML event and state macros

    -   incorrect event type passed to a direct entry state\'s on_entry
        action

    -   more examples

## From V2.12 to V2.20 (Boost 1.46)

-   Compile-time state machine analysis using mpl_graph:

    -   `checking of region orthogonality`.

    -   `search for unreachable states`.

    -   `automatic region index search for pseudo entry or explicit entry states`.

-   `Boost.Parameter interface definition` for
    msm::back::state_machine\<\> template arguments.

-   `Possibility to provide a container` for the event and deferred
    event queues. A policy implementation based on a more efficient
    Boost.CircularBuffer is provided.

-   msm::back::state_machine\<\>::is_flag_active method made const.

-   added possibility to `enqueue events` for delayed processing.

-   Bugfixes

    -   Trac 4926

    -   stack overflow using the Defer functor

    -   anonymous transition of a submachine not called for the initial
        state

## From V2.10 to V2.12 (Boost 1.45)

-   Support for `serialization`

-   `Possibility to use normal functors` (from functor front-end) in
    eUML.

-   `New constructors` where substates / submachines can be taken as
    arguments. This allows passing arguments to the constructor of a
    submachine.

-   Bugfixes

## From V2.0 to V2.12 (Boost 1.44)

-   New documentation

-   Internal transitions. Either as part of the transition table or
    using a state\'s internal transition table

-   increased dispatch and copy speed

-   `new row types` for the basic front-end

-   new eUML syntax, better attribute support, macros to ease
    developer\'s life. Even VC8 seems to like it better.

-   New policy for reduced compile-time at the cost of dispatch speed

-   Support for base events

-   possibility to choose the initial event

## msm/common.hpp

This header provides one type, wrap, which is an empty type whose only
reason to exist is to be cheap to construct, so that it can be used with
mpl::for_each, as shown in the Metaprogramming book, chapter 9.

template \<class Dummy\> wrap{};

## msm/row_tags.hpp

This header contains the row type tags which front-ends can support
partially or totally. Please see the `Internals` section for a
description of the different types.

Back-end

The back-end headers

## msm/back/state_machine.hpp

This header provides one type, state_machine, MSM\'s state machine
engine implementation.

template \<class Derived,class HistoryPolicy=NoHistory,class
CompilePolicy=favor_runtime_speed\> state_machine

### Template arguments

#### Derived

The name of the front-end state machine definition. All three front-ends
are possible.

#### HistoryPolicy

The desired history. This can be: AlwaysHistory, NoHistory,
ShallowHistory. Default is NoHistory.

#### CompilePolicy

The trade-off performance / compile-time. There are two predefined
policies, favor_runtime_speed and favor_compile_time. Default is
favor_runtime_speed, best performance, longer compile-time. See [the
backend](#backend-tradeof-rt-ct).

### methods

#### start

The start methods must be called before any call to process_event. It
activates the entry action of the initial state(s). This allows you to
choose when a state machine can start. See [backend](#backend-start).

void start

#### process_event

The event processing method implements the double-dispatch. Each call to
this function with a new event type instantiates a new dispatch
algorithm and increases compile-time.

template \<class Event\> HandledEnum process_event

Event const&

#### current_state

Returns the ids of currently active states. You will typically need it
only for debugging or logging purposes.

const int\* current_state const

#### get_state_by_id

Returns the state whose id is given. As all states of a concrete state
machine share a common base state, the return value is a base state. If
the id corresponds to no state, a null pointer is returned.

const BaseState\* get_state_by_id const

int id

#### is_contained

Helper returning true if the state machine is contained as a submachine
of another state machine.

bool is_contained const

#### get_state

Returns the required state of the state machine as a pointer. A compile
error will occur if the state is not to be found in the state machine.

template \<class State\> State\* get_state

#### get_state

Returns the required state of the state machine as a reference. A
compile error will occur if the state is not to be found in the state
machine.

template \<class State\> State& get_state

#### is_flag_active

Returns true if the given flag is currently active. A flag is active if
the active state of one region is tagged with this flag (using OR as
BinaryOp) or active states of *all* regions (using AND as BinaryOp)

template \<class Flag,class BinaryOp\> bool is_flag_active

#### is_flag_active

Returns true if the given flag is currently active. A flag is active if
the active state of one region is tagged with this flag.

template \<class Flag\> bool is_flag_active

#### visit_current_states

Visits all active states and their substates. A state is visited using
the `accept` method without argument. The base class of all states must
provide an `accept_sig` type.

void visit_current_states

#### visit_current_states

Visits all active states and their substates. A state is visited using
the `accept` method with arguments. The base class of all states must
provide an `accept_sig` type defining the signature and thus the number
and type of the parameters.

void visit_current_states

any-type param1, any-type param2,\...

#### defer_event

Defers the provided event. This method can be called only if at least
one state defers an event or if the state machine provides the
`activate_deferred_events` (see
[example](../examples/Orthogonal-deferred2.cpp)) type either directly or
using the deferred_events configuration of eUML
(`configure_ << deferred_events`).

template \<class Event\> void defer_event

Event const&

### Types

#### nr_regions

The number of orthogonal regions contained in the state machine

#### entry_pt

This nested type provides the necessary typedef for entry point
pseudostates. `state_machine<...>::entry_pt<state_name>` is a
transition\'s valid target inside the containing state machine\'s
transition table.

entry_pt

#### exit_pt

This nested type provides the necessary typedef for exit point
pseudostates. `state_machine<...>::exit_pt<state_name>` is a
transition\'s valid source inside the containing state machine\'s
transition table.

exit_pt

#### direct

This nested type provides the necessary typedef for an explicit entry
inside a submachine. `state_machine<...>::direct<state_name>` is a
transition\'s valid target inside the containing state machine\'s
transition table.

direct

#### stt

Calling state_machine\<frontend\>::stt returns a mpl::vector containing
the transition table of the state machine. This type can then be used
with generate_state_set or generate_event_set.

## args.hpp

This header provides one type, args, which provides the necessary types
for a visitor implementation.

<a id="history-interface"></a>
## msm/back/history_policies.hpp

This header provides the out-of-the-box history policies supported by
MSM. There are 3 such policies.

### Every history policy must implement the following methods:

#### set_initial_states

This method is called by msm::back::state_machine when constructed. It
gives the policy a chance to save the ids of all initial states (passed
as array).

void set_initial_states

int\* const

#### history_exit

This method is called by msm::back::state_machine when the submachine is
exited. It gives the policy a chance to remember the ids of the last
active substates of this submachine (passed as array).

void history_exit

int\* const

#### history_entry

This method is called by msm::back::state_machine when the submachine is
entered. It gives the policy a chance to set the active states according
to the policy\'s aim. The policy gets as parameter the event which
activated the submachine and returns an array of active states ids.

template \<class Event\> int\* const history_exit

Event const&

### Out-of-the-box policies:

#### NoHistory

This policy is the default used by state_machine. No active state of a
submachine is remembered and at every new activation of the submachine,
the initial state(s) are activated.

#### AlwaysHistory

This policy is a non-UML-standard extension. The active state(s) of a
submachine is (are) always remembered at every new activation of the
submachine.

#### ShallowHistory

This policy activates the active state(s) of a submachine if the event
is found in the policy\'s event list.

## msm/back/default_compile_policy.hpp

This header contains the definition of favor_runtime_speed. This policy
has two settings:

-   Submachines dispatch faster because their transitions are added into
    their containing machine\'s transition table instead of simply
    forwarding events.

-   It solves transition conflicts at compile-time

## msm/back/favor_compile_time.hpp

This header contains the definition of favor_compile_time. This policy
has two settings:

-   Submachines dispatch is slower because all events, even those with
    no dispatch chance, are forwarded to submachines. In exchange, no
    row is added into the containing machine\'s transition table, which
    reduces compile-time.

-   It solves transition conflicts at run-time.

## msm/back/metafunctions.hpp

This header contains metafunctions for use by the library. Three
metafunctions can be useful for the user:

-   `generate_state_set< stt >`: generates the list of all states
    referenced by the transition table stt. If stt is a recursive table
    (generated by `recursive_get_transition_table`), the metafunction
    finds recursively all states of the submachines. A non-recursive
    table can be obtained with some_backend_fsm::stt.

-   `generate_event_set< stt>`: generates the list of all events
    referenced by the transition table stt. If stt is a recursive table
    (generated by `recursive_get_transition_table`), the metafunction
    finds recursively all events of the submachines. A non-recursive
    table can be obtained with some_backend_fsm::stt.

-   `recursive_get_transition_table<fsm>`: recursively extends the
    transition table of the state machine fsm with tables from the
    submachines.

## msm/back/tools.hpp

This header contains a few metaprogramming tools to get some information
out of a state machine.

### fill_state_names

#### attributes

fill_state_names has for attribute:

-   `char const** m_names`: an already allocated array of const char\*
    where the typeid-generated names of a state machine states will be
    witten.

#### constructor

char const\*\* names_to_fill

#### usage

fill_state_names is made for use in a mpl::for_each iterating on a state
list and writing inside a pre-allocated array the state names. Example:

    typedef some_fsm::stt Stt;
    typedef msm::back::generate_state_set<Stt>::type all_states; //states
    static char const* state_names[mpl::size<all_states>::value];
    // array to fill with names
    // fill the names of the states defined in the state machine
    mpl::for_each<all_states,boost::msm::wrap<mpl::placeholders::_1> > 
        (msm::back::fill_state_names<Stt>(state_names));
    // display all active states
    for (unsigned int i=0;i<some_fsm::nr_regions::value;++i)
    {
        std::cout << " -> " 
                  << state_names[my_fsm_instance.current_state()[i]] 
                  << std::endl;
    }

### get_state_name

#### attributes

get_state_name has for attributes:

-   std::string& m_name: the return value of the iteration

-   int m_state_id: the searched state\'s id

#### constructor

The constructor takes as argument a reference to the string to fill with
the state name and the id which must be searched.

string& name_to_fill,int state_id

#### usage

This type is made for the same search as in the previous example, using
a mpl::for_each to iterate on states. After the iteration, the state
name reference has been set.

    // we need a fsm's table
    typedef player::stt Stt;
    typedef msm::back::generate_state_set<Stt>::type all_states; //all states
    std::string name_of_open; // id of Open is 1
    // fill name_of_open for state of id 1
    boost::mpl::for_each<all_states,boost::msm::wrap<mpl::placeholders::_1> > 
              (msm::back::get_state_name<Stt>(name_of_open,1));
    std::cout << "typeid-generated name Open is: " <<  name_of_open << std::endl;

### display_type

#### attributes

none

#### usage

Reusing the state list from the previous example, we can output all
state names:

`mpl::for_each<all_states,boost::msm::wrap<mpl::placeholders::_1> >(msm::back::display_type ());`

Front-end

The front-end headers

## msm/front/common_states.hpp

This header contains the predefined types to serve as base for states or
state machines:

-   default_base_state: non-polymorphic empty type.

-   polymorphic_state: type with a virtual destructor, which makes all
    states polymorphic.

## msm/front/completion_event.hpp

This header contains one type, `none`. This type has several meanings
inside a transition table:

-   as action or guard: that there is no action or guard

-   as target state: that the transition is an internal transition

-   as event: the transition is an anonymous (completion) transition

## msm/front/functor_row.hpp

This header implements the functor front-end\'s transitions and helpers.

### Row

#### definition

template \<class Source,class Event,class Target,class Action,class
Guard\> Row

#### tags

row_type_tag is defined differently for every specialization:

-   all 5 template parameters means a normal transition with action and
    guard: `typedef row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,Target,none,none\> a normal transition without
    action or guard: `typedef _row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,Target,Action,none\> a normal transition without
    guard: `typedef a_row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,Target,none,Guard\> a normal transition without
    action: `typedef g_row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,none,Action,none\> an internal transition without
    guard: `typedef a_irow_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,none,none,Guard\> an internal transition without
    action: `typedef g_irow_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,none,none,Guard\> an internal transition with
    action and guard: `typedef irow_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Row\<Source,Event,none,none,none\> an internal transition without
    action or guard: `typedef _irow_tag row_type_tag;`

#### methods

Like any other front-end, Row implements the two necessary static
functions for action and guard call. Each function receives as parameter
the (deepest-level) state machine processing the event, the event
itself, the source and target states and all the states contained in a
state machine.

template \<class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState, class
AllStates\> static void action_call

Fsm& fsm,Event const& evt,SourceState&,TargetState,AllStates&

template \<class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState, class
AllStates\> static bool guard_call

Fsm& fsm,Event const& evt,SourceState&,TargetState,AllStates&

### Internal

#### definition

template \<class Event,class Action,class Guard\> Internal

#### tags

row_type_tag is defined differently for every specialization:

-   all 3 template parameters means an internal transition with action
    and guard: `typedef sm_i_row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Internal\<Event,none,none\> an internal transition without action or
    guard: `typedef sm__i_row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Internal\<Event,Action,none\> an internal transition without guard:
    `typedef sm_a_i_row_tag row_type_tag;`

-   Internal\<Event,none,Guard\> an internal transition without action:
    `typedef sm_g_i_row_tag row_type_tag;`

#### methods

Like any other front-end, Internal implements the two necessary static
functions for action and guard call. Each function receives as parameter
the (deepest-level) state machine processing the event, the event
itself, the source and target states and all the states contained in a
state machine.

template \<class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState, class
AllStates\> static void action_call

Fsm& fsm,Event const& evt,SourceState&,TargetState,AllStates&

template \<class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState, class
AllStates\> static bool guard_call

Fsm& fsm,Event const& evt,SourceState&,TargetState,AllStates&

#### methods

This helper functor is made for use in a transition table and in a state
behavior and therefore implements an operator() with 3 and with 4
arguments:

template \<class Evt,class Fsm,class SourceState,class TargetState\>
operator() Evt const& ,Fsm& ,SourceState& ,TargetState&

template \<class Evt,class Fsm,class State\> operator() Evt const&,
Fsm&, State&

### Defer

#### definition

## msm/front/state_machine_def.hpp

This header provides the implementation of the `basic front-end`. It
contains one type, `state_machine_def`

### state_machine_def definition

This type is the basic class for a basic (or possibly any other)
front-end. It provides the standard row types (which includes internal
transitions) and a default implementation of the required methods and

#### methods

`state_machine_def` provides a default implementation in case of an
event which cannot be processed by a state machine (no transition
found). The implementation is using a `BOOST_ASSERT` so that the error
will only be noticed in debug mode. Overwrite this method in your
implementation to change the behavior.

template \<class Fsm,class Event\> static void no_transition Event
const& ,Fsm&, int state

`state_machine_def` provides a default implementation in case an
exception is thrown by a state (entry/exit) or transition (action/guard)
behavior. The implementation is using a `BOOST_ASSERT` so that the error
will only be noticed in debug mode. Overwrite this method in your
implementation to change the behavior. This method will be called only
if exception handling is not deactivated (default) by defining
`has_no_message_queue`.

template \<class Fsm,class Event\> static void exception_caught Event
const& ,Fsm&, std::exception&

## msm/front/states.hpp

This header provides the different states (except state machines) for
the basic front-end (or mixed with other front-ends).

### types

This header provides the following types:

#### no_sm_ptr

deprecated: default policy for states. It means that states do not need
to save a pointer to their containing state machine.

#### sm_ptr

deprecated: state policy. It means that states need to save a pointer to
their containing state machine. When seeing this flag, the back-end will
call set_sm_ptr(fsm\*) and give itself as argument.

#### state

Basic type for simple states. Inherit from this type to define a simple
state. The first argument is needed if you want your state (and all
others used in a concrete state machine) to inherit a basic type for
logging or providing a common behavior.

template\<class Base = default_base_state,class SMPtrPolicy =
no_sm_ptr\> state

#### terminate_state

Basic type for terminate states. Inherit from this type to define a
terminate state. The first argument is needed if you want your state
(and all others used in a concrete state machine) to inherit a basic
type for logging or providing a common behavior.

template\<class Base = default_base_state,class SMPtrPolicy =
no_sm_ptr\> terminate_state

#### interrupt_state

Basic type for interrupt states. Interrupt states prevent any further
event handling until EndInterruptEvent is sent. Inherit from this type
to define a terminate state. The first argument is the name of the event
ending the interrupt. The second argument is needed if you want your
state (and all others used in a concrete state machine) to inherit a
basic type for logging or providing a common behavior.

The EndInterruptEvent can also be a sequence of events:
mpl::vector\<EndInterruptEvent,EndInterruptEvent2\>.

template\<class EndInterruptEvent,class Base = default_base_state,

class SMPtrPolicy = no_sm_ptr\> interrupt_state

#### explicit_entry

Inherit from this type *in addition* to the desired state type to enable
this state for direct entering. The template parameter gives the region
id of the state (regions are numbered in the order of the
`initial_state` typedef).

template \<int ZoneIndex=-1\> explicit_entry

#### entry_pseudo_state

Basic type for entry pseudo states. Entry pseudo states are a predefined
entry into a submachine and connect two transitions. The first argument
is the id of the region entered by this state (regions are numbered in
the order of the `initial_state` typedef). The second argument is needed
if you want your state (and all others used in a concrete state machine)
to inherit a basic type for logging or providing a common behavior.

template\<int RegionIndex=-1,class Base = default_base_state,

class SMPtrPolicy = no_sm_ptr\> entry_pseudo_state

#### exit_pseudo_state

Basic type for exit pseudo states. Exit pseudo states are a predefined
exit from a submachine and connect two transitions. The first argument
is the name of the event which will be \"thrown\" out of the exit point.
This event does not need to be the same as the one sent by the inner
region but must be convertible from it. The second argument is needed if
you want your state (and all others used in a concrete state machine) to
inherit a basic type for logging or providing a common behavior.

template\<class Event,class Base = default_base_state,

class SMPtrPolicy = no_sm_ptr\> exit_pseudo_state

## msm/front/euml/euml.hpp

This header includes all of eUML except the STL functors.

## msm/front/euml/stl.hpp

This header includes all the functors for STL support in eUML. These
`tables` show a full description.

## msm/front/euml/algorithm.hpp

This header includes all the functors for STL algorithms support in
eUML. These `tables` show a full description.

## msm/front/euml/iteration.hpp

This header includes iteration functors for STL support in eUML. This
`table` shows a full description.

## msm/front/euml/querying.hpp

This header includes querying functors for STL support in eUML. This
`table` shows a full description.

## msm/front/euml/transformation.hpp

This header includes transformation functors for STL support in eUML.
This `table` shows a full description.

## msm/front/euml/container.hpp

This header includes container functors for STL support in eUML
(functors calling container methods). This `table` shows a full
description. It also provides npos for strings.

### Npos\_\<container type\>

Functor returning npos for transition or state behaviors. Like all
constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are necessary.
Example:

`string_find_(event_(m_song),Char_<'S'>(),Size_t_<0>()) != Npos_<string>() // compare result of string::find with npos`

## msm/front/euml/stt_grammar.hpp

This header provides the transition table grammars. This includes
internal transition tables.

### functions

#### build_stt

The function build_stt evaluates the grammar-conforming expression as
parameter. It returns a transition table, which is a mpl::vector of
transitions (rows) or, if the expression is ill-formed (does not match
the grammar), the type `invalid_type`, which will lead to a compile-time
static assertion when this transition table is passed to a state
machine.

template\<class Expr\> \[mpl::vector\<\...\> /
msm::front::euml::invalid_type\] build_stt

Expr const& expr

#### build_internal_stt

The function build_internal_stt evaluates the grammar-conforming
expression as parameter. It returns a transition table, which is a
mpl::vector of transitions (rows) or, if the expression is ill-formed
(does not match the grammar), the type `invalid_type`, which will lead
to a compile-time static assertion when this transition table is passed
to a state machine.

template\<class Expr\> \[mpl::vector\<\...\> /
msm::front::euml::invalid_type\] build_internal_stt

Expr const& expr

### grammars

#### `transition table<a id="reference-stt-grammar"></a>

The transition table accepts the following grammar:

    Stt := Row | (Stt ',' Stt)
    Row := (Target '==' (SourcePlusEvent)) /* first syntax*/
           | ( (SourcePlusEvent) '==' Target ) /* second syntax*/
           | (SourcePlusEvent) /* internal transitions */
    SourcePlusEvent := (BuildSource '+' BuildEvent)/* standard transition*/ 
                       | (BuildSource) /* anonymous transition */
    BuildSource := state_tag | (state_tag '/' Action) | (state_tag '[' Guard ']') 
                | (state_tag '[' Guard ']' '/' Action)
    BuildEvent := event_tag | (event_tag '/' Action) | (event_tag '[' Guard ']') 
                | (event_tag '[' Guard ']' '/' Action)

The grammars Action and Guard are defined in state_grammar.hpp and
guard_grammar.hpp respectively. state_tag and event_tag are inherited
from euml_state (or other state variants) and euml_event respectively.
For example, following declarations are possible:

    target == source + event [guard] / action,
    source + event [guard] / action == target,
    source + event [guard] / (action1,action2) == target,
    target == source + event [guard] / (action1,action2),
    target == source + event,
    source + event == target,
    target == source + event [guard],
    source + event [guard] == target,
    target == source + event / action,
    source + event /action == target,
    source / action == target, /*anonymous transition*/
    target == source / action, /*anonymous transition*/
    source + event /action, /* internal transition*/

#### internal transition table

The internal transition table accepts the following grammar:

    IStt := BuildEvent | (IStt ',' IStt)

BuildEvent being defined for both internal and standard transition
tables.

## msm/front/euml/guard_grammar.hpp

This header contains the `Guard` grammar used in the previous section.
This grammar is long but pretty simple:

    Guard := action_tag | (Guard '&&' Guard) 
            | (Guard '||' Guard) | ... /* operators*/
            | (if_then_else_(Guard,Guard,Guard)) | (function (Action,...Action))

Most C++ operators are supported (address-of is not). With `function` is
meant any eUML predefined function or any self-made (using
`MSM_EUML_METHOD` or `MSM_EUML_FUNCTION`). Action is a grammar defined
in state_grammar.hpp.

## msm/front/euml/state_grammar.hpp

This header provides the grammar for actions and the different grammars
and functions to build states using eUML.

### action grammar

Like the guard grammar, this grammar supports relevant C++ operators and
eUML functions:

    Action := action_tag | (Action '+' Action) 
              | ('--' Action) | ... /* operators*/
              | if_then_else_(Guard,Action,Action) | if_then_(Action) 
              | while_(Guard,Action) 
              | do_while_(Guard,Action) | for_(Action,Guard,Action,Action) 
              | (function(Action,...Action))
    ActionSequence := Action | (Action ',' Action)

Relevant operators are: ++ (post/pre), \-- (post/pre), dereferencing, +
(unary/binary), - (unary/binary), \*, /, %, &(bitwise), \| (bitwise),
\^(bitwise), +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=, \<\<=, \>\>=, \<\<, \>\>, =, \[\].

### attributes

This grammar is used to add attributes to states (or state machines) or
events: It evaluates to a fusion::map. You can use two forms:

-   `attributes_ << no_attributes_`

-   `attributes_ << attribute_1 << ... << attribute_n`

Attributes can be of any default-constructible type (fusion
requirement).

### configure

This grammar also has two forms:

-   `configure_ << no_configure_`

-   `configure_ << type_1 << ... << type_n`

This grammar is used to create inside one syntax:

-   flags: `configure_ << some_flag` where some_flag inherits from
    `euml_flag<some_flag>` or is defined using BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG.

-   deferred events: `configure_ << some_event` where some_event
    inherits from `euml_event<some_event>` or is defined using
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT or BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES.

-   configuration (message queue, manual deferring, exception handling):
    `configure_ << some_config` where some_config inherits from
    `euml_config<some_config>`. At the moment, three predefined objects
    exist (in msm//front/euml/common.hpp):

    -   no_exception: disable catching exceptions

    -   no_msg_queue: disable message queue

    -   deferred_events: manually enable handling of deferred events

### initial states

The grammar to define initial states for a state machine is:
`init_ << state_1 << ... << state_n` where state_1\...state_n inherit
from euml_state or is defined using BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE,
BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERRUPT_STATE, BOOST_MSM_EUML_TERMINATE_STATE,
BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE, BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE or
BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE.

### functions

#### build_sm

This function has several overloads. The return type is not relevant to
you as only decltype (return type) is what one needs.

#### build_explicit_entry_state

This function has the same overloads as build_entry_state and
explicit_entry_func_state as return type.

## msm/front/euml/common.hpp

### types

#### euml_event

The basic type for events with eUML.

template \<class EventName\> euml_event;

    struct play : euml_event<play>{};

#### euml_state

The basic type for states with eUML. You will usually not use this type
directly as it is easier to use BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE,
BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERRUPT_STATE, BOOST_MSM_EUML_TERMINATE_STATE,
BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE, BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE or
BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE.

template \<class StateName\> euml_state;

You can however use this type directly if you want to provide your state
with extra functions or provide entry or exit behaviors without
functors, for example:

    struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> , public euml_state<Empty> 
    {
        void foo() {...}
        template <class Event,class Fsm>
        void on_entry(Event const& evt,Fsm& fsm){...}
    };

#### euml_flag

The basic type for flags with eUML.

template \<class FlagName\> euml_flag;

    struct PlayingPaused: euml_flag<PlayingPaused>{};

#### euml_action

The basic type for state or transition behaviors and guards with eUML.

template \<class AcionName\> euml_action;

    struct close_drawer : euml_action<close_drawer>
    {
        template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState>
        void operator()(Evt const& , Fsm&, SourceState& ,TargetState& ) {...}
    };

Or, as state entry or exit behavior:

    struct Playing_Entry : euml_action<Playing_Entry>
    {
        template <class Event,class Fsm,class State>
        void operator()(Event const&,Fsm& fsm,State& ){...}
    };

#### euml_config

The basic type for configuration possibilities with eUML.

template \<class ConfigName\> euml_config;

You normally do not use this type directly but instead the instances of
predefined configuration:

-   no_exception: disable catching exceptions

-   no_msg_queue: disable message queue. The message queue allows you to
    send an event for processing while in an event processing.

-   deferred_events: manually enable handling of deferred events

#### invalid_type

Type returned by grammar parsers if the grammar is invalid. Seeing this
type will result in a static assertion.

#### no_action

Placeholder type for use in entry/exit or transition behaviors, which
does absolutely nothing.

#### source\_

Generic object or function for the source state of a given transition:

-   as object: returns by reference the source state of a transition,
    usually to be used by another function (usually one created by
    MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(source_)

-   as function: returns by reference the attribute passed as parameter.

    Example:

        source_(m_counter)++

#### target\_

Generic object or function for the target state of a given transition:

-   as object: returns by reference the target state of a transition,
    usually to be used by another function (usually one created by
    MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(target_)

-   as function: returns by reference the attribute passed as parameter.

    Example:

        target_(m_counter)++

#### state\_

Generic object or function for the state of a given entry / exit
behavior. state\_ means source\_ while in the context of an exit
behavior and target\_ in the context of an entry behavior:

-   as object: returns by reference the current state, usually to be
    used by another function (usually one created by MSM_EUML_METHOD or
    MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(state_) // calls some_user_function on the current state

-   as function: returns by reference the attribute passed as parameter.

    Example:

        state_(m_counter)++

#### event\_

Generic object or function for the event triggering a given transition
(valid in a transition behavior, as well as in state entry/exit
behaviors):

-   as object: returns by reference the event of a transition, usually
    to be used by another function (usually one created by
    MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(event_)

-   as function: returns by reference the attribute passed as parameter.

    Example:

        event_(m_counter)++

#### fsm\_

Generic object or function for the state machine containing a given
transition:

-   as object: returns by reference the event of a transition, usually
    to be used by another function (usually one created by
    MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(fsm_)

-   as function: returns by reference the attribute passed as parameter.

    Example:

        fsm_(m_counter)++

#### substate\_

Generic object or function returning a state of a given state machine:

-   with 1 parameter: returns by reference the state passed as
    parameter, usually to be used by another function (usually one
    created by MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION).

    Example:

        some_user_function_(substate_(my_state))

-   with 2 parameters: returns by reference the state passed as first
    parameter from the state machine passed as second parameter, usually
    to be used by another function (usually one created by
    MSM_EUML_METHOD or MSM_EUML_FUNCTION). This makes sense when used in
    combination with attribute\_.

    Example (equivalent to the previous example):

        some_user_function_(substate_(my_state,fsm_))

#### attribute\_

Generic object or function returning the attribute passed (by name) as
second parameter of the thing passed as first (a state, event or state
machine). Example:

    attribute_(substate_(my_state),cd_name_attribute)++

#### True\_

Functor returning true for transition or state behaviors. Like all
constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are necessary.
Example:

    if_then_(True_(),/* some action always called*/)

#### False\_

Functor returning false for transition or state behaviors. Like all
constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are necessary.
Example:

    if_then_(False_(),/* some action never called */)

#### Int\_\<int value\>

Functor returning an integer value for transition or state behaviors.
Like all constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are
necessary. Example:

    target_(m_ringing_cpt) = Int_<RINGING_TIME>() // RINGING_TIME is a constant

#### Char\_\<char value\>

Functor returning a char value for transition or state behaviors. Like
all constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are
necessary. Example:

    // look for 'S' in event.m_song
    [string_find_(event_(m_song),Char_<'S'>(),Size_t_<0>()) != Npos_<string>()]

#### Size_t\_\<size_t value\>

Functor returning a size_t value for transition or state behaviors. Like
all constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are
necessary. Example:

    substr_(event_(m_song),Size_t_<1>()) // returns a substring of event.m_song

#### String\_ \< mpl::string \>

Functor returning a string for transition or state behaviors. Like all
constants, only the functor form exists, so parentheses are necessary.
Requires boost \>= 1.40 for mpl::string.

Example:

    // adds "Let it be" to fsm.m_src_container
    push_back_(fsm_(m_src_container), String_<mpl::string<'Let','it ','be'> >())

#### Predicate\_ \< some_stl_compatible_functor \>

This functor eUML-enables a STL functor (for use in an algorithm). This
is necessary because all what is in the transition table must be a eUML
terminal.

Example:

    //equivalent to: 
    //std::accumulate(fsm.m_vec.begin(),fsm.m_vec.end(),1,std::plus<int>())== 1
    accumulate_(begin_(fsm_(m_vec)),end_(fsm_(m_vec)),Int_<1>(),
                Predicate_<std::plus<int> >()) == Int_<1>())

#### process\_

This function sends an event to up to 4 state machines by calling
`process_event` on them:

-   `process_(some_event)` : processes an event in the current
    (containing) state machine.

-   `process_(some_event [,fsm1...fsm4] )` : processes the same event in
    the 1-4 state machines passed as argument.

#### process2\_

This function sends an event to up to 3 state machines by calling
`process_event` on them and copy-constructing the event from the data
passed as second parameter:

-   `process2_(some_event, some_data)` : processes an event in the
    current (containing) state machine.

-   `process2_(some_event, some_data [,fsm1...fsm3] )` : processes the
    same event in the 1-3 state machines passed as argument.

Example:

    // processes NotFound on current state machine, 
    // copy-constructed with event.m_song
    process2_(NotFound,event_(m_song))

With the following definitions:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE(std::string,m_song)//declaration of m_song
    NotFound (const string& data) // copy-constructor of NotFound

#### is_flag\_

This function tells if a flag is active by calling `is_flag_active` on
the current state machine or one passed as parameter:

-   `is_flag_(some_flag)` : calls `is_flag_active` on the current
    (containing) state machine.

-   `is_flag_(some_flag, some_fsm)` : calls `is_flag_active` on the
    state machine passed as argument.

#### defer\_

This object defers the current event by calling `defer_event` on the
current state machine. Example:

    Empty() + play() / defer_

#### explicit\_(submachine-name,state-name)

Used as transition\'s target, causes an explicit entry into the given
state from the given submachine. Several explicit\_ as targets,
separated by commas, means a fork. The state must have been declared as
such using BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE.

#### entry_pt\_(submachine-name,state-name)

Used as transition\'s target from a containing state machine, causes
submachine-name to be entered using the given entry pseudo-state. This
state must have been declared as pseudo entry using
BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE.

#### exit_pt\_(submachine-name,state-name)

Used as transition\'s source from a containing state machine, causes
submachine-name to be left using the given exit pseudo-state. This state
must have been declared as pseudo exit using BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE.

#### MSM_EUML_FUNCTION

This macro creates an eUML function and a functor for use with the
functor front-end, based on a free function:

-   first parameter: the name of the functor

-   second parameter: the underlying function

-   third parameter: the eUML function name

-   fourth parameter: the return type if used in a transition behavior

-   fifth parameter: the return type if used in a state behavior
    (entry/exit)

Note that the function itself can take up to 5 arguments.

Example:

    MSM_EUML_FUNCTION(BinarySearch_,std::binary_search,binary_search_,bool,bool)

Can be used like:

    binary_search_(begin_(fsm_(m_var)),end_(fsm_(m_var)),Int_<9>())

#### MSM_EUML_METHOD

This macro creates an eUML function and a functor for use with the
functor front-end, based on a method:

-   first parameter: the name of the functor

-   second parameter: the underlying function

-   third parameter: the eUML function name

-   fourth parameter: the return type if used in a transition behavior

-   fifth parameter: the return type if used in a state behavior
    (entry/exit)

Note that the method itself can take up to 4 arguments (5 like for a
free function - 1 for the object on which the method is called).

Example:

    struct Empty : public msm::front::state<> , public euml_state<Empty> 
    {
         void activate_empty() {std::cout << "switching to Empty " << std::endl;}
    ... 
    };
    MSM_EUML_METHOD(ActivateEmpty_,activate_empty,activate_empty_,void,void)

Can be used like:

    Empty == Open + open_close / (close_drawer , activate_empty_(target_))

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_ACTION(action-instance-name)

This macro declares a behavior type and a const instance for use in
state or transition behaviors. The action implementation itself follows
the macro declaration, for example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_ACTION(good_disk_format)
    {
         template <class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState>
         void/bool operator()(Evt const& evt,Fsm&,SourceState& ,TargetState& ){...}
    };

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG(flag-instance-name)

This macro declares a flag type and a const instance for use in
behaviors.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG_NAME(flag-instance-name)

This macro returns the name of the flag type generated by
BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG. You need this where the type is required (usually
with the back-end method is_flag_active). For example:

    fsm.is_flag_active<BOOST_MSM_EUML_FLAG_NAME(CDLoaded)>()

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE(event-type,event-name)

This macro declares an attribute called event-name of type event-type.
This attribute can then be made part of an attribute list using
BOOST_MSM_EUML_ATTRIBUTES.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_ATTRIBUTES(attributes-expression,attributes-name)

This macro declares an attribute list called attributes-name based on
the expression as first argument. These attributes can then be made part
of an event using BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES, of a state as
3rd parameter of BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE or of a state machine as 5th
parameter of BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE.

Attributes are added using left-shift, for example:

    // m_song is of type std::string
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE(std::string,m_song)
    // contains one attribute, m_song
    BOOST_MSM_EUML_ATTRIBUTES((attributes_ << m_song ), FoundDef)

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT(event-instance name)

This macro defines an event type (event-instance-name_helper) and
declares a const instance of this event type called event-instance-name
for use in a transition table or state behaviors.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES(event-instance-name,attributes)

This macro defines an event type (event-instance-name_helper) and
declares a const instance of this event type called event-instance-name
for use in a transition table or state behaviors. The event will have as
attributes the ones passed by the second argument:

`BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES(Found,FoundDef)`

The created event instance supports operator()(attributes) so that

    my_back_end.process_event(Found(some_string))

is possible.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_NAME(event-instance-name)

This macro returns the name of the event type generated by
BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT or BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES. You need
this where the type is required (usually inside a back-end definition).
For example:

    typedef msm::back::state_machine<Playing_,
    msm::back::ShallowHistory<mpl::vector<BOOST_MSM_EUML_EVENT_NAME(end_pause)
    > > > Playing_type;

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE(build-expression,state-instance-name)

    events (plain msm deferred events) and a non-default base state (as
    defined in standard MSM).

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE(int region-index,build-expression,state-instance-name)

This macro defines a submachine\'s substate type
(state-instance-name_helper), which can be explicitly entered and also
declares a const instance of this state type called state-instance-name
for use in a transition table or state behaviors.

There are several possibilities for the expression syntax:

-   (): state without entry or exit action.

-   (Expr1): state with entry but no exit action.

-   (Expr1,Expr2): state with entry and exit action.

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes): state with entry and exit action, defining
    some attributes.

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes,Configure): state with entry and exit
    action, defining some attributes and flags (standard MSM flags) or
    deferred events (standard MSM deferred events).

-   (Expr1,Expr2,Attributes,Configure,Base): state with entry and exit
    action, defining some attributes, flags and deferred events (plain
    msm deferred events) and a non-default base state (as defined in
    standard MSM).

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE_NAME(state-instance-name)

This macro returns the name of the state type generated by
BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE or other state macros. You need this where the type
is required (usually using a backend function). For example:

    fsm.get_state<BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE_NAME(StringFind)&>().some_state_function();

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE(build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE but does not provide an instance, simply a
type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_INTERRUPT_STATE(build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERRUPT_STATE but does not provide an instance,
simply a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_TERMINATE_STATE(build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_TERMINATE_STATE but does not provide an instance,
simply a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_EXIT_STATE(build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXIT_STATE but does not provide an instance, simply
a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_ENTRY_STATE(int region-index,build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_ENTRY_STATE but does not provide an instance, simply
a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE(int region-index,build-expression,state-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_EXPLICIT_ENTRY_STATE but does not provide an
instance, simply a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE(expression, table-instance-name)

This macro declares a transition table type and also declares a const
instance of the table which can then be used in a state machine
declaration (see BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE_MACHINE). The expression
must follow the `transition table grammar`.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_TRANSITION_TABLE(iexpression,table-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE but does not provide an instance,
simply a type declaration.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_INTERNAL_TRANSITION_TABLE(expression, table-instance-name)

This macro declares a transition table type and also declares a const
instance of the table. The expression must follow the
`transition table grammar`. For the moment, this macro is not used.

#### BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_INTERNAL_TRANSITION_TABLE(iexpression,table-instance-name)

Like BOOST_MSM_EUML_TRANSITION_TABLE but does not provide an instance,
simply a type declaration. This is currently the only way to declare an
internal transition table with eUML. For example:

    BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_STATE((Open_Entry,Open_Exit),Open_def)
    struct Open_impl : public Open_def
    {
        BOOST_MSM_EUML_DECLARE_INTERNAL_TRANSITION_TABLE((
              open_close [internal_guard1] / internal_action1 ,
              open_close [internal_guard2] / internal_action2
        ))
    };
